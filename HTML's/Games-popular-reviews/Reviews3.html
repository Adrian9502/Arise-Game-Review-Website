        BY CHARLIE WACHOLZ | UPDATED: NOV 21,2023 | POSTED: NOV 18, 2023 5:23AM
      </span>

      <p>
        It’s nothing short of a miracle that a sequel as well-made as
        Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 managed to arrive just two years after the
        original. Developer Fair Play Labs’ second attempt at a
        Nickelodeon-based platform fighter is a massive leap forward from the
        first, with a more polished feel, more vibrant characters, and the coup
        de grace: its envelope-pushing Slime meter. It took me a minute to get
        comfortable with its slightly buffered movement and wildly expressive
        Slime mechanics, but after a handful of late nights with friends – both
        online and off – I couldn’t put it down. While comparisons to the Super
        Smash Bros. series can cast an obnoxious shadow over this genre, it’s
        not an exaggeration to say that the only other platform-fighting sequel
        to improve, rework, and refine what came before it to this impressive
        degree was the legendary Super Smash Bros. Melee itself.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve spent literally thousands of hours in platform fighters like Super
        Smash Bros. and Rivals of Aether, and classic Nickelodeon cartoons like
        Spongebob SquarePants and Avatar: The Last Airbender are some of my
        all-time favorite shows – so I was very disappointed by how much I
        didn’t like the original All-Star Brawl in 2021. It had the usual
        platform-fighting structure of damaging up your opponent before knocking
        them off the screen for a kill, but the animations and sound design were
        flat, it didn’t seem particularly polished, and most of the characters
        felt the same. Deeper than that, I found it mechanically unrewarding,
        with poorly tuned movement that prioritized hollow speed over precision.
        Instead of weaving a combo together based on my opponent’s damage, the
        attacks at my disposal, and my position on the stage, I felt more
        incentivized to string together the same busted attack over and over
        again until I could spike my poor opponent into the blast zone.
        <br /><br />
        It’s incredible, then, that All-Star Brawl 2 takes nearly every
        frustration and complaint I had with the first one and inverts them.
        Combos are deeper and more fleshed out thanks to multiple revamped
        mechanics, hits feel more substantial and satisfying thanks to beefed up
        sound design and improved animations, and movement strikes a much better
        balance between speed and precision. And perhaps most exciting of all,
        its excellent cast of characters shine thanks to their updated, more
        cartoony models and well-acted voice lines delivered by many of their
        original voice actors.
      </p>

      <h2>Every animation cleverly references something from the cartoons.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2017080/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1702995323" />

      <p>
        Fanservice and nostalgia are often wielded with all the tact of an
        ill-fated Krabby Patty secret formula attempt – using them as seasoning,
        rather than the main ingredient, is almost always important. Not so in a
        crossover fighting game, however. Games like Marvel vs. Capcom and Super
        Smash Bros. rightly revel in nostalgia, and All-Star Brawl 2 similarly
        dives straight into the deep end. Every animation and attack for every
        single character cleverly references something from the original cartoon
        shows. For example, SpongeBob’s neutral weak aerial is a pose he does
        during the radical Goofy Goober Rock scene from The SpongeBob
        SquarePants Movie, Ren and Stimpy throw out the iconic Log from their
        show’s parody commercials, and Aang rides around on his signature ball
        of air. <br /><br />
        But these referential movesets aren’t just hollow, with most characters
        having different gameplans, specialized meters, and other bespoke
        mechanics that add a fun, necessary level of diversity. SpongeBob,
        All-Star Brawl 2’s all-around character, is pretty good at everything,
        but isn’t especially strong at one particular thing more than any other
        fighter, and he’s a bit floatier in his movement. Compare that to the
        devastating damage and heavy-hitting combos of Reptar and the difference
        is clear, with momentum-based movement that feels like controlling a
        hulking dinosaur should – but that raw power means you won’t have a
        prayer when you’re trying to get back on the stage. Meanwhile, Garfield
        has a decent combo game, but doesn’t have many reliable options for
        killing until his lasagna meter (yes, you read that correctly) gets
        filled up and he becomes faster and stronger.
      </p>

      <h2>
        This is the kind of cast that puts a fighting game into the next
        stratosphere.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://m.economictimes.com/thumb/msid-102459355,width-1600,height-900,resizemode-4,imgsize-91852/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-see-confirmed-and-leaked-fighters-of-game.jpg" />

      <p>
        It’s hard for me to talk about the different ways characters function
        without going on an overexcited rant about each and every one because
        they all offer something unique and interesting. Where it took me
        forever to pick a main in the previous game because I just couldn’t find
        a character that stood out to me, it’s taken me a long time to find one
        in All-Star Brawl 2 because I like so much of its cast. After putting
        every fighter through the motions in the single-player Arcade mode, I
        found myself excited to explore a whopping half of its 26 characters
        further. I can’t remember the last time I was this torn and this excited
        to spend time playing as such a wide swath of different characters in a
        platform fighter.
        <br /><br />
        This is the kind of diverse cast that puts a fighting game into the next
        stratosphere. Zim is a puppet character now and has the ability to
        control Gir with greater accuracy, the Angry Beavers work less like Ice
        Climbers and more like a team from a tag-based 2D fighter with moves
        that may remind you of some well-known assists from games like Dragon
        Ball FighterZ, and Plankton is a weird mix between a grappler and a
        zoner with ranged grabs and wonky projectiles.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        That cast hasn’t come without sacrifices, though. Not only have a
        handful of favorites from the previous game been cut, including CatDog
        and Toph Beifong, but it’s a little weird to see main characters from
        their own series not show up. Grandma Gertie and Gerald from Hey,
        Arnold! are playable, for example, but Arnold himself is nowhere to be
        seen. The same goes for Reptar standing in for any of the Rugrats. While
        I can understand why that might frustrate some, these choosier omissions
        leave room for All-Star Brawl 2’s cast to have more diverse playstyles.
        Reptar is one of the game’s few heavy characters, and both Grandma
        Gertie and Gerald’s movesets bring a lot of distinct, cool flair to the
        cast in a way that feels worth the trade-off.
        <br /><br />
        While new characters may get the spotlight, even the returning cast
        brings something fresh and new to the brawl. Fair Play Labs has fully
        rebuilt every aspect of this sequel, so no character is the same as they
        were in the previous game. This huge rework may sound like overkill, but
        it’s a necessary step in making every fighter work with the new Slime
        mechanic, All-Star Brawl 2’s greatest innovation.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Slime mechanic is versatile, easy to manage, and well-balanced.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        I cannot overstate how much style and finesse Slime adds to this game.
        With just a single button press and a sufficiently filled Slime meter,
        you can add extra power to any of your special moves, boost your air
        dodge, cancel out of freefall after using your recovery, boost that
        recovery further, cancel out of any move’s ending animations, and even
        escape enemy combos. Versatile, easy to manage, and well-balanced, Slime
        is an effective tool no matter what character you’re playing or how good
        you are at All-Star Brawl 2.
        <br /><br />
        Slime also grants characters the ability to do a beefy ultimate attack,
        complete with goofy mini-cutscenes like what you might expect from a
        Final Smash. Cool as they are, these cutscenes do sometimes pierce the
        veil of All-Star Brawl 2’s otherwise strong art style. Maybe it’s the PC
        I’m playing on, but models and animations seem to take a dip in quality
        during some of these Slime attacks compared to normal gameplay. It’s not
        present across the board, but Aang’s super, for example, brings his
        model close enough to cover a good chunk of the screen. At that scale,
        it has a pixelated, grainy look that comes off especially rough compared
        to when he’s airbending across the stage. It looks like the models used
        for fighting are the same ones that appear in these cutscenes, but some
        of them don’t seem like they were designed to be seen that up-close and
        personal.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Mastering Slime is a gripping push-pull I’ve never seen in a game like
        this.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        Lowering the barrier of entry on those more complex techniques while
        also adding depth makes the impossible suddenly feel possible. I’ve been
        playing platform fighters since before I could read, and from the moment
        I became good enough at them to scrape together a basic combo, I’ve
        always chased those tricky combo options that seem like they should
        work, but lie tantalizingly just out of reach. In that regard, Slime is
        my childhood wish fulfilled. The more time I put into All-Star Brawl 2,
        the more I find myself searching for the next rule I can use it to
        break. It’s a gripping push-and-pull that I’ve never experienced in a
        game like this.
        <br /><br />
        Slime isn’t the only new addition, though. As if to further tout its
        illustrious voice cast, All-Star Brawl 2 also has a Campaign mode that
        features even more voice actors reprising their iconic roles. The story
        itself isn’t much more than connective tissue written so that our
        favorite Nicktoons can crossover with one another thanks to Clockwork
        from Danny Phantom, but it does make for some fun moments. Most of the
        interactions I’ve found feature characters from SpongeBob encountering
        each other in the course of a run through this roguelite mode, but there
        are other surprises too. I think my favorite is an interaction where
        Clockwork and SpongeBob talk about whether or not Patrick has a brain.
        It all has the same energy you’d expect from a crossover episode during
        a Saturday morning cartoon block.
      </p>

      <h2>The campaign is no Hades, but it is a servicable roguelite mode.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Like most of the other challenges found in its Campaign mode, boss
        fights aren’t anything too novel compared to what we’ve seen in similar
        games, but they’re still fun. And the upgrade systems and randomly
        generated nature of it help to keep things fresher than they would be
        otherwise. Unfortunately, this is no Hades or Slay The Spire. Running
        through a series of diverse challenges that put your mastery of
        different gameplay elements and mechanics to the test makes for a
        completely serviceable roguelite, but there isn’t much compelling beyond
        what’s already fun about All-Star Brawl 2 elsewhere. I never felt the
        gambling sensation that comes from balancing risk against reward in a
        good roguelike, where making a desperate play to get ahead might just
        cut a good run short. Nor did I ever get that nagging “one more time”
        feeling compelling me to pick away at the itchy scab left by a run gone
        wrong.
        <br /><br />
        Other single-player options include an Arcade mode, which uses the same
        challenge level types found in the Campaign and mashes them up with
        specially-themed fights, like teaming up with SpongeBob to fight
        Plankton. It’s a big improvement on the original All-Star Brawl’s much
        shorter, less curated Arcade Mode – I just wish it had more going on to
        distinguish it from the very comparable Campaign mode.
        <br /><br />
        Surprisingly, the Training mode is far and away the crown jewel of
        All-Star Brawl 2’s single-player options. This is probably the best
        training mode I’ve seen implemented in a platform fighter that doesn’t
        require hacking your Switch, with impressive options I’d usually expect
        to see in fan-made mods for training modes in other games. That includes
        hitbox visualization, knockback trajectories, an input display, and even
        frame data. It’s still years behind the training modes found in
        traditional fighting games that feature character-specific trials and
        tutorials, but it’s quite impressive for this genre.
        <br /><br />
        Online play is another competitive feather in All-Star Brawl 2’s cap. I
        haven’t been able to find any ranked matches during the pre-release
        review period, but online lobbies with both friends and strangers work
        really well thanks to its buttery-smooth rollback netcode; a must for
        any contemporary fighting game. I had a few problems when playing online
        with friends who weren’t updated to the same game version as me, and
        while it boggles my mind that there weren’t fail-safes for that kind of
        thing, it was the only issue I ran into with online play. After patching
        and hopping back into the fray, the gap from Chicago to Los Angeles
        suddenly closed and it felt so smooth that my friend might as well have
        been on the couch next to me.
