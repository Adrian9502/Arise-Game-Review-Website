        BY CHARLIE WACHOLZ | UPDATED: NOV 21,2023 | POSTED: NOV 18, 2023 5:23AM
      </span>
      <p>
        Like the four Ultimate Ninja Storm games before it, Naruto x Boruto
        Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections is a comprehensive ode to the world and
        characters created by Masashi Kishimoto. Its immense cast of playable
        characters, each with exceptionally well-animated movesets, and a
        heaping handful of maps ripped straight from the anime with loving
        detail look better than ever before. But no level of source material
        accuracy can save this absolute mammoth of a game from hollow
        single-player content and a stale combat system that hasn’t meaningfully
        changed in fifteen years.
        <br /><br />
        As far as Naruto fans go, I’m a bit of a weirdo. I was actually first
        introduced to the series ten years ago through Ultimate Ninja Storm 3,
        and I still vividly remember marveling at that entry’s shockingly big
        roster compared to most fighting games. That spurred me to get caught up
        with the show, and then I found myself further hooked thanks to the
        story mode’s faithful recreation of that fictional world. But while I
        stayed a Naruto fan, my friends and I eventually moved on to games with
        more depth, like Super Smash Bros. That’s because in order to support a
        roster that’s aptly described as a literal storm of ninjas, the combat
        has to stay pretty simple. This makes it approachable and easy to
        master, but there’s also no pot of gold to chase at the end of this
        learning curve like there is in better fighting games.
      </p>

      <p>
        Combos flow like a watered-down version of Devil May Cry or Bayonetta;
        you can add variations to your moves, but most of the time you’ll be
        pressing the single attack button until your combo ends with a flashy
        finisher – unless you’re quick enough to cancel it into a special move
        or a dash before rinsing and repeating. Combo finishers usually end by
        launching your opponent across the map into the ground, putting them out
        of reach from a follow-up dash. This is where the real game begins:
        you’ll need to master and understand the ebb and flow of blocking,
        attacking, grabbing, and moving to get up close and personal so you can
        lock your opponent into yet another devastating flurry of blows.
        <br /><br />
        Most of the characters in these games are (unsurprisingly) ninjas, which
        means they’re highly agile and each have three magic abilities to show
        off in the heat of battle. Just about anything goes here: Kiba teams up
        with his trusty pooch Akamaru to rush down and drill his opponents into
        a pulp, Kisame shoots shark-shaped water bombs from a safe distance, and
        Raikage Ay slams with thunderous force, creating a massive shockwave.
        But the drawback of that shared ninja DNA is that, aside from the stray
        puppet user like Chiyo or Sasori, most characters draw their movesets
        from the same small pool – albeit with different coats of paint.
      </p>
      <h2>Most characters draw their movesets from the same small pool.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        With 130 playable characters (though many of them are duplicates of main
        characters, with one or more extra variations of the same person taking
        up a lot of real estate), choosing a character based on their playstyle
        is less important than choosing a character you like from the show. That
        roster sounds impressive, but it actually feels barren as a fan, with
        only a few characters from Boruto, most of whom are just grown-up
        versions of other playable fighters. For something that’s billed as a
        definitive celebration of the whole series, Ninja Storm Connections
        falls disappointingly short.
        <br /><br />
        Playstyles are generally so similar too that you could swap most
        characters’ voice lines and models with another and not see a huge
        difference. That said, using each character to their fullest potential
        takes a lot of savvy resource management and patient play, which is
        where Ninja Storm games shine. Using these special techniques consumes
        chakra, the Naruto series’ life-granting spiritual essence. On top of
        that, you’ll also need to keep an eye on your substitution gauge, which
        allows your character to escape any combo or attack at the push of a
        button. But you only have four substitutions at your disposal, and using
        multiple will cause your gauge to refill very slowly. This all adds some
        extra sauce to the otherwise one-note combat as players dash and jump
        all over its 3D arenas.
      </p>
      <h2>Connections disappointingly doesn’t use rollback netcode online.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        Its single-player story options, on the other hand, are something of a
        letdown. The History Mode lets you poorly relive the story of Naruto and
        friends from the beginning of the original series, which follows him as
        a kid through the end of Naruto Shippuden three years later. Special
        Story Mode, on the other hand, is a predictable and rarely exciting
        original story written by series creator Masashi Kishimoto set in the
        time of Naruto’s son, Boruto, whose own manga series is still ongoing.
        <br /><br />
        I love the world and story of Naruto. Its complex politics, incredibly
        fleshed-out history, well-defined characters with rich backgrounds, and
        interweaving relationships are the foundation of why this series has
        remained so popular over the years. Unfortunately, Ninja Storm
        Connections’ approach to that story does it no favors. Parsed out like a
        half-baked flashback, History Mode truncates the events of Naruto and
        Shippuden in slapdash fashion. Yes, these games are designed with the
        fans in mind and most of the people playing through its roughly
        seven-hour recap will probably already know these events like the back
        of their hand, but that doesn’t excuse shoddy storytelling.
        <br /><br />
        Instead of cutscenes, subtitled stills from the anime pop up in-between
        the occasional fight, with sound effects like clashing kunai and some
        sporadic screen-shaking as the only attempts to add flavor. I’m sure
        it’s challenging to condense entire arcs spanning dozens of episodes
        into roughly 40-minute-long chapters, but I’m equally sure it could’ve
        been done in a more interesting way than this. These “movies,” as the
        game refers to them, are narrated by the Naruto world’s god-like figure,
        The Sage of Six Paths. This detached perspective, delivered in English
        via voice actor Michael McConnohie’s hypnotic rasp, is great in a
        vacuum, but boring in the broader context of a series that involves so
        many distinct characters and performances by talented voice actors. And
        that’s if a given movie is fortunate enough to have any voiceover
        whatsoever.
        <br /><br />
        You’ll rarely hear from the actual characters involved in these moments,
        which play out more like YouTube lore videos than interesting scenes.
        Instead, whenever a memorable quote comes up, our disembodied narrator
        reads it like he’s a teacher reading a book to a group of
        kindergarteners. In the same way that a poorly-placed repeated flashback
        can deflate the tension of an intense moment in an anime, so too can a
        comically offbeat line read. This isn’t through any fault of the
        narrator’s performance – he’s doing his best with what’s been given to
        him. This is a fault that sweeps this entire mode’s framing, which is
        just not a good way to retell this show.
      </p>

        Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections reviewed by Charlie
        Wacholz on PlayStation 5 and PC, also available on Xbox Series X and
        Nintendo Switch. Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections may
        have the biggest roster and flashiest graphics in the series, but its
        unenthusiastic re-telling of the source material in what should be a
        celebration of Naruto, Shippuden, and Boruto falls flat. Even when it’s
        fun and nostalgic, there’s almost nothing here to seek out over past
        entries with basically the same fighting system and better single-player
        stories. If all you want is the newest, biggest, and shiniest way to
        watch your favorite shinobi battle it out, Ninja Storm Connections at
        least delivers that. But just because it understands the assignment
        doesn’t mean its execution gets high marks.
