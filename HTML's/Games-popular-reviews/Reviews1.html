      <p>
        The words impossible port, punching above its weight, and even black
        magic are thrown around often when it comes to games on diminutive
        hardware. With Hogwarts Legacy, now launching on the Nintendo’s Switch,
        it could be another time to wheel out those tropes… but not quite.
        Hogwarts Legacy is not a miracle port, despite squeezing onto the Switch
        (quite literally, with a 7.4GB install size compared to 22.1GB on the
        Xbox One version). It manages to be better than feared, yet in places
        still rough as expected.
      </p>
      <h2>Hexed Objects</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Hogwarts Legacy on Switch offers only a single performance mode, with
        few options to choose from. This is a step down from the Xbox One
        version, which has motion blur, film grain and even an unlocked
        frame-rate toggle. To be clear, this is a last generation game
        through-and-through, as we discussed in our original performance review.
        This already reduces the pressure on this Switch port, but further
        reductions are required in order to mitigate the drastic reduction in
        CPU and GPU power, as well as lower memory size and bandwidth. On
        Switch, we have similar levels of performance to the Xbox One version,
        though some areas are worse. These mostly seem to be memory and/or
        CPU-bound sections of data streaming, keeping the world fed with data
        and cleaning up behind as it goes. The result is a game that can run
        pretty well at 30fps in non-stressful areas outside of battles and
        loading sectors. But during these moments it is often closer to the 50ms
        frame time, meaning we see frame rate around 24-25 fps for prolonged
        periods. That’s not great, and the sluggishness can be felt without a
        frame analysis.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Textures, objects, and walls pop in as you explore the halls of Hogwarts
        Castle, causing stuttering and lurching.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img
        src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/rce/9f73461e-8ab3-4181-aeda-54244415a1b8.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=1000"
      />
      <p>
        The biggest issues though come from general instantiation (creation) of
        objects and removal of others, which can cause huge 100-200ms spikes,
        resulting in lurching and pausing as frame rates drop into the low
        teens. Hogwarts Castle itself is the biggest culprit of these. Textures,
        objects, and walls pop in as you cut classes and explore the halls,
        causing stuttering and lurching. It’s worth noting that even the
        current-gen consoles and PC sometimes suffer from these same stutters
        and pauses, but the Switch is affected the most here, especially in
        dense areas, like among trees, in the castle, and when animating
        characters, with frame rates often below 30fps. The average across 10+
        minutes of tested sections is still 28.3fps with a 95% frame time of
        50ms, which is not great but certainly far from the worst game on
        Switch, and the amount being pushed here is impressive considering the
        hardware.
      </p>
      <h2>Stupefying Stutters</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The single biggest challenge for this port is the tiny memory pool of
        the Switch. 4GB LPDDR5 RAM is all that's available, and the game likely
        gets around 3.5GB, which is half that of the Xbox One, at most. Video
        capture is disabled in the game, highlighting the choices made to use
        all the RAM possible. The result is that the game has been redesigned
        quite extensively for this port. Loading is long in the last generation
        versions and by and large this is the same here. This impact is no more
        apparent than in the increased sector points exclusive to this port.
        Entering Hogsmeade used to be an open stroll up the main high street,
        whereas on Switch this is around a minute or so to load. Entering shops
        in Hogsmeade used to be seamless, whereas now we are met with a load for
        each door you enter and the same for the way out. All this, alongside
        the existing extra loading the last-generation versions added, means the
        Switch is competing with Starfield for the award of most Loading
        encountered in 2023.
        <br /><br />
        As expected, resolution is a big cut, targeting 1280x720 in docked mode
        with very little to no anti-aliasing coverage, with dynamic resolution
        scaling giving a counted low of approximately 1024x576. This is a good
        result, as handheld mode is often 960x540. It may and likely does run
        DRS, but expect this as the best case or average result. Due to the
        small 720p screen it never looks bad here, although it is still very
        noisy with shimmer and blurry textures. Aside from the very low pixel
        counts, the other huge cut is texture quality.
        <br /><br />
        The game can struggle with mip-map loading from its Unreal Engine 4
        base, which means even with such a drastic cut to texture assets, we
        still see low quality mip-maps and incredibly low texture filtering,
        although the opening prologue is much better. When in the open map of
        the game, though, we see soft, soupy textures on everything. In
        addition, we also see massive light reductions – even the sun appears to
        have moved. Shadow maps are much shorter in cascade and quality, and
        interiors use less light and fewer shadow casting sources. The core
        physically-based materials are also largely gone now, with the layers
        reduced to base albedo and specular, giving us an Xbox 360/PS3
        generational look. Supporting this is the massive reduction in object
        triangle count. Objects are less rounded and very hexagonal-looking
        compared to the Xbox One. Areas have also been changed to save on space
        and performance. Animated objects in windows are now plain textures, and
        views are walled off to save on geometry load and save precious CPU and
        GPU time.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Characters suffer the most, with stiffer and more robotic mouths and
        expressions
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <img
        src="https://images.pushsquare.com/ba44444be81f6/hogwarts-legacy-guide-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-and-all-collectibles-1.large.jpg"
      />
      <p>
        Characters suffer the most, with faces and expressions being impacted by
        the reduced level of detail, which can change the look and movement of
        faces. The animated bone rigging underneath is also dramatically
        reduced, leaving much stiffer and more robotic mouths and expressions.
        Shadows are very low resolution and can flicker and pop on faces when
        talking. All these things add up to a stark difference between the Xbox
        One and Switch versions, with reductions in lights, shadows, details,
        hair cards, animation, textures, and world detail. In addition, we also
        see huge cuts to grass, tree quality, world clutter, and NPCs. Even
        motion blur and SSR are removed, along with many sections that had rain
        are now removed or reduced. Water bodies rely on projected cube maps
        only for reflections which is understandable as it can be a GPU-heavy
        effect.Sound is better than I had feared. The quality and clarity is
        severely compressed as expected, with the volume increased on the Switch
        to compensate and you also get fewer sound effects and even miss music
        at times, although this may be a memory related bug. All the voices,
        music, sound effects are included, though with a decent TV setup you may
        notice more pop, fizzle, and compression issues than on any other
        version.
      </p>
      <h2>Shrinking the Magic</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        Hogwarts Legacy was always going to be an uphill battle trying to fit
        onto the Switch, but the team achieved it. Loading, resolution, and
        performance all take a hit, but generally they are on the right side of
        playable, especially compared to such big games as Pokemon Scarlet and
        Violet last year, with Hogwarts certainly pushing much more demanding
        visuals, quality and scale. Although the world, detail, and quality has
        been drastically cut back, it has been done intelligently so, showing
        the extensive use of plain textures for details, more billboard trees,
        and blockier objects. Think more VHS copy than cinema film print. Fine
        detail, material accuracy, color clarity, scale, and overall quality are
        sacrificed heavily, but you can make out the same wonder if you squint
        and use your imagination… and a little magic.
