      <p>
        Remember how many dildos were originally in Cyberpunk 2077? You couldn’t
        loot a corner in Night City without picking one up, to the point where
        CD Projekt Red actually had to patch a number of them out. Lootable
        dildos weren’t necessarily a problem on their own, but their abundance
        was a good example of how Cyberpunk’s grand story could occasionally
        clash with the cheap shock humor found around it. Phantom Liberty aims
        to right that dildo misalignment, and after some soul-searching, has
        seemingly found what kind of Cyberpunk story it wants to tell, and nails
        it. Balancing the punk-rock verve of Mike Pondsmith’s tabletop RPG with
        an exquisitely crafted spy story and best-in-class visuals, Phantom
        Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best.
        <br /><br />
        Phantom Liberty begins with the President of the NUS crash landing in a
        self-governed district of Night City called Dogtown, and you’re hired by
        her Secret Service detail to rescue her. From there you will meet the
        two most important new characters in the expansion, Song So-Mi, an NUSA
        hacker excellently played by Christine Minji Chang, and Solomon Reed, a
        sleeper agent who is brought back into commission portrayed by the
        iconic Idris Elba.
      </p>

      <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4194848-vlcscreenshot2023-09-18-04h18m08s819.jpg" />

      <p>
        Elba is again channeling his city-wise American accent from The Wire,
        only this time on the other side of the law. He’s definitely not phoning
        this role in either, delivering a thoroughly captivating performance as
        a secret agent who made me so desperately want to trust him even though
        he is Night City’s greatest spy, and therefore probably never telling
        the full truth. Phantom Liberty relies heavily on make-or-break
        decisions that can’t be taken back, and Reed is part of the reason why
        those choices become so difficult.
        <br /><br />
        Keanu Reeves also makes a return as Johnny Silverhand. Maybe it’s the
        years since I last played, but I feel Reeves is actually better this
        time around, performance-wise. Honestly, I think it’s that he has better
        material to work with in Phantom Liberty, which requires him to rattle
        off fewer diatribes about screwing over the system. Instead, the
        expanded story lets Reeves explore Silverhand’s mournful side, delving
        into his existence as a failed revolutionary imprisoned in someone
        else’s body. But more than that, between Elba, Reeves, and Chang,
        Phantom Liberty does a great job highlighting just how advanced its
        character animations are compared to some other big-budget RPGs. At the
        intersection of performance and technology, CDPR has found something in
        Cyberpunk 2077 that can genuinely move you. Just wait until you meet
        Reed’s spy associate, Alex.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Phantom Liberty harnesses this wild energy into mature storytelling.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Overall, Phantom Liberty has a much firmer grasp on what kinds of
        stories can be told in Night City. It’s a metropolis full of political
        wheelings and dealings, all manner of crime, and more than its fair
        share of idiots, and that’s unique in the sci-fi hacker genre compared
        to the dour and operatic worlds of Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell.
        Cyberpunk 2077 is grunge and metal, and Phantom Liberty harnesses this
        wild energy into mature storytelling – something the outstanding
        animated Netflix show, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, also managed to capture.
        <br /><br />
        Elevated by Elba’s and Chang’s respective performances, Phantom Liberty
        hits all the things I love in a Cyberpunk story: it hones in on the
        hopelessness of hyper-capitalism and the dehumanizing effects of
        technology on our souls, all while using the spy motif to introduce some
        new themes to the world. How can we trust anyone when every element of
        the future has been so thoroughly taken over by automated forces of
        corporations and government? It has more to say than I expected going
        in, and more than I could have hoped for after my initial playthrough of
        Cyberpunk 2077.
      </p>

      <h2>
        CDPR has played a wicked trick by infusing side missions with complex
        moral dilemmas.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/review/c/cyberpunk-/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty_7get.1920.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Similarly, CDPR gets a ton of mileage out of its spy premise. There are
        exciting moments where you’re channeling your best Ethan Hunt from
        Mission: Impossible, complete with a new face to trick your targets, as
        well as an entire section that was very clearly inspired by Skyfall. I
        was curious to learn how an espionage plot could fit into Cyberpunk
        2077’s story about varying levels of criminality – from the dingiest
        streets to the tallest executive corporate suite – but Phantom Liberty
        reminds us that the government, too, is part of our hyper-capitalist
        meat grinder, and not much separates a government agent from a
        streetwise fixer.
        <br /><br />
        It’s serious business, but whenever the storyline begins to feel too
        heavy you can take on side jobs for Mr. Hands, a fixer whose clientele
        ranges from kidnapped arms dealers to a doting resident who just wants
        to rescue her dumb-as-bricks fiance and his even dumber friend. But make
        no mistake: CDPR has played a wicked trick by infusing these side
        missions with the same kind of complex moral dilemmas you’re forced to
        resolve during the main campaign.
        <br /><br />
        What remains just as impressive as it was the first time I played
        Cyberpunk 2077 is Night City, which is still one of gaming’s great
        locations. The sense of awe at its scale hasn’t faded, and returning
        there after three years I find myself with the same level of admiration
        for CDPR’s grand work. Maybe even more so, given that Phantom Liberty
        adds an entire new district to the already-packed city. Sure, the idea
        of an independent Dogtown is a bit confusing if you’re not familiar with
        the lore, but this lawless Thunderdome proves to be a great setting for
        Phantom Liberty’s paranoid spy-thriller.
      </p>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This new area draws visual inspiration from both Las Vegas and Santa
        Monica: it’s part beach town, part luxury resort destination, with
        extravagant hotels, glamorous night clubs, and a football stadium that’s
        been converted into a city center. The line that “the location is also a
        character” has never been truer than it is here. There’s so much fun in
        wandering around Dogtown and discovering some hidden storyline or bit of
        environmental storytelling. It’s almost an anti-Tears of the Kingdom,
        where the joy isn’t in emergent bits of gameplay but in archaeologically
        uncovering secrets hidden throughout the area. There was always
        something magical about exploring Night City’s skyline, and doing it
        again knowing that no other game since has replicated this feat is just
        as impressive. This is one game I never want to fast-travel through.
        <br /><br />
        Without spoilers, there’s a specific point in the expansion’s story
        where it will diverge based on your decisions, leading you down one of
        two very distinct paths and endings. I played both for this review and
        found that one certainly feels more “canon” than the other. There’s also
        an entirely new ending that’s been added to the base game that feels
        like it might be the de facto true ending, and takes Phantom Liberty’s
        themes of self-sacrifice and near-future alienation and uses them to
        wrap up V and Silverhand’s story. I may start an entire new save to
        experience this story fully, from beginning to end. With all of the
        impressive changes in Cyberpunk 2077’s free 2.0 update that arrived
        alongside this DLC’s launch, starting fresh is actually something I’m
        looking forward to.
      </p>
      <h2>I’m finally able to create a true netrunner character.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        On that note, while Phantom Liberty isn’t required to install the 2.0
        update, it’s hard to say that the revamped gameplay didn’t positively
        influence my experience as I played through 20 hours of Phantom Liberty.
        In particular, the newly reworked skill tree that makes it easier to
        build your character towards specific playstyles was a revelation. I had
        always wanted to play my character as a hacking netrunner, but in the
        1.0 release in 2020, hacking was a pretty limp tool that let me do
        little more than distract enemies while waiting for a chance to shoot at
        them. With 2.0’s revamped cyberware system, I’m able to not only equip
        more cyberware at once, but the new skill tree makes it easier to
        enhance both my cybernetic and hacking abilities. I’m finally able to
        create a true netrunner character, someone capable of getting a group of
        enemies to point guns at each other if I want them to. Whether you’re
        pursuing a hacker build, augment-build, or something else, this alone
        makes Cyberpunk 2077 a much better experience than it was in 2020.
        <br /><br />
        To be clear, these are improvements that all Cyberpunk 2077 owners can
        experience even without buying Phantom Liberty. The expansion doesn’t
        include much in the way of exclusive abilities, but does feature some
        exclusive clothes and weapons. The weapons, in particular, are very much
        themed after the spy stories Phantom Liberty has taken inspiration from,
        giving us access to very fun, very powerful stealth tools that will let
        you infiltrate the deadliest den of thieves without getting caught. If
        you’re planning on coming back to Night City for another run, I cannot
        recommend enough that you take a detour to Dogtown while you’re here.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Last year, I said in my review of Cyberpunk Edgerunners that CDPR now
        has a blueprint for where to go with Cyberpunk 2077, and Phantom Liberty
        shows the studio already had exactly that in mind. Between a more
        sophisticated level of storytelling with excellent performances, smarter
        insights on the cyberpunk genre and its dystopian themes, and landing on
        top of a much-improved gameplay experience thanks to its fresh 2.0
        update, Phantom Liberty marks a new chapter for Cyberpunk 2077 and is
        finally close to what I’d hoped it would be when I first sat down to
        play three years ago.
