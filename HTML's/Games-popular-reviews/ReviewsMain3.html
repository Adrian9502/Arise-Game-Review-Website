        BY BRENDAN GRAEBER | UPDATED: SEP 23, 2023 9:33 AM | POSTED: SEP 22,
        2023 5:44 AM
      </span>

      <p>
        Resident Evil 4 sure knows how to set the tone: the remake’s intro sees
        Leon slowly advancing through creepy woods and rotting, ominous houses,
        culminating in the horrifying crescendo that is the infamous village
        attack. But with that groundwork already laid, The Separate Ways DLC has
        no need for such a slow build-up, and smartly wastes very little time
        shifting into high gear: we’re put up against an extremely imposing boss
        mere minutes after taking control of Ada Wong, the star of this show. In
        fact, though it only took me just over four hours to complete this side
        story’s seven chapters, Separate Ways rarely wastes a moment of your
        time, and proves to be a highly entertaining roller coaster that
        includes some very satisfying new takes on ideas from its original 2005
        inspiration.
        <br /><br />
        The story of our cool and competent covert operative runs basically
        parallel to that of Leon Kennedy’s quest to find the President’s
        daughter in a remote Spanish village, and while their paths often
        intersect in interesting ways, it’s the objectives that Ada follows on
        behalf of a familiar shadowy figure – and some revelations that should
        surprise even those who know the original’s story inside and out – that
        make her adventure worth playing.
        <br /><br />
        Where the original included more than a few “Go help Leon before he dies
        a nasty death” tasks, the remake’s Separate Ways feel more like a
        believable arc of Ada having to choose between leaving emotions at the
        door and putting the mission first, all while lending her own brand of
        assistance (but still looking for a way to use the situation to her
        advantage later). Ada’s story in Separate Ways also has more room to
        breathe than it did in the 2005 version, with less focus on retelling
        Leon’s story from a different angle, and more about her growing
        reluctance to put her client before her allies.
      </p>
      <h2>The fights stand out from what Leon has to deal with.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/resident-evil-4/6/6e/Separate_ways_hub.png" />
      <p>
        Rather than having Ada largely follow Leon’s familiar story path and
        events as the original Separate Ways did, this particular version does
        an exemplary job of giving Ada her own adversaries to contend with in a
        variety of ways. Right from the get-go, Ada’s own private antagonist in
        the form of a relentless, black-robed monstrosity that stalks her for a
        good portion of the story. The fights you have stand out from what Leon
        has to deal with, even as you find yourself in familiar locations.
        There’s a wonderful range of encounters — from zipping between rooftops
        to avoid an El Gigante’s attacks, to panicked escapes from unstoppable
        killing machines. With Ada’s story being as condensed as it is compared
        to what Leon goes through, every encounter remains fast and fresh,
        repeat performances feel exceedingly rare, and every boss fight has a
        new surprise.
        <br /><br />
        You’ll revisit a lot of the same locations seen by Leon during Separate
        Ways, and while that may not sound exciting, Capcom makes smart use of
        familiar terrain by changing the context — often having you fight
        through enemies going a different direction than Leon did — which
        provides new ambush points, enemy surprises, and new pathways to learn
        that weren’t there before. I especially liked how some places that were
        mostly a lull in the action for Leon, like the old factory and village
        chief’s house, had different foes waiting for Ada this time around.
        <br /><br />
        However, Separate Ways isn’t solely content to retread old ground, and
        some interesting choices are made on when to send Ada off into uncharted
        territory. These places might not be too wildly off the beaten path, but
        they do make for some entertaining moments, such as turning a corner and
        realizing you’re actually right above an area that Leon will arrive at
        soon after, letting you watch a familiar cutscene from a very different
        point of view. While some cutscenes will obviously play out just as they
        did from Leon’s perspective, there were plenty of fun twists on seeing
        exactly what Ada and Luis were doing when one of them contacted Leon on
        the radio. Even though you can’t exactly alter destiny and team up
        directly, it was always cool to hear Leon fighting off hordes of
        villagers nearby, or hearing faint crying while scaling a church
        rooftop.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m also extremely pleased to announce that if — like me — you were
        bummed about certain scenic spots from the 2005 Resident Evil 4 not
        appearing in RE4 Remake, you may greatly enjoy how Separate Ways manages
        to find unexpected ways to sprinkle recognizable sewers, gondolas, and
        high-tech labs into Ada’s path.
        <br /><br />
        Ada herself is no slouch, and benefits from all the same features that
        Leon enjoys in RE4 Remake in addition to some nifty new gadgets of her
        own. She can sneak, slit throats, parry, and kick just as well as Leon,
        and her unique grapple gun allows her to zip-kick straight to a stunned
        enemy as if she were a guest character in a Batman Arkham game. I found
        it incredibly useful, using it to zip past swarms looking to pin me down
        and scatter them like bowling pins, pulling off headshots all the while.
        The grapple gun also works to quickly platform across areas in a hurry,
        and though it only attaches in very specific spots, it gave me new ways
        to move around many of the larger open areas and let me pull off
        maneuvers like grappling across the castle’s courtyard maze to intercept
        a fleeing zealot, or escaping quickly when I was backed into a corner.
      </p>

      <h2>The Batman similarities don’t stop there.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHCK6Cbn3UM/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        The Batman similarities don’t stop there: when Ada isn’t zipping across
        rooftops like Leon Kennedy’s version of the Dark Knight, she also
        employs her own detective vision mode with special contact lenses to
        solve a few puzzles. Unfortunately, none of this is anywhere near as
        flashy as the grapple gun, and more than once I was told to solve the
        thrilling mystery of “follow these specific footprints along a very
        straightforward path.” Part of me wishes there was more that could be
        done with the gadget, but I’m also glad these simpler puzzle ideas were
        used sparingly enough that it didn’t ruin the pacing.
        <br /><br />
        Aside from having to occasionally get her informant Luis Sera out of
        trouble, Ada isn’t constrained by the ebb and flow of RE4 Remake’s main
        story. There’s no helpless girl to haul around or somber moments of rest
        and reflection before the next leg of the journey, and Separate Ways
        takes full advantage of this by rarely dialing things down. In her quest
        to acquire a specimen for her client, there’s rarely a dull moment. You
        can still chat up the mysterious Merchant and upgrade Ada’s unique
        shotgun and explosive bow, and there’s oodles of treasure to find by
        spotting chests and hanging objects, but I appreciate that Separate Ways
        doesn’t try and slow its momentum with shooting range minigames (though
        Ada can still buy charms to gain passive bonuses, which is a great
        touch). There are even a few merchant requests to take on if you do want
        to take things slower; my favorite was trying to find a few camouflaged
        Novistadors in an area before moving on, which required careful scanning
        of walls and ceilings (with the help of a bio-sensor).
      </p>
      <h2>There’s rarely a dull moment.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://i0.wp.com/eyeofthetigernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/t5UGeLkkdkS2F7oM3vHoVX.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1" alt="" />
      <p>
        While the story is destined to end with Leon’s showdown with Saddler, I
        appreciate that Capcom didn’t shy away from giving Ada a chance to shine
        on her own, culminating in a one-two punch of a satisfying solo boss
        fight, and a behind the scenes race to help Leon deliver the killing
        blow that matched the heart-pounding pace of Leon’s eventual escape from
        the island. There’s even some added context to Ada’s ending we don’t see
        from Leon’s point of view, and it’s left me intrigued about what the
        developer has in store for their inevitable Resident Evil 5 Remake.
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways lifts up and reinvents Ada Wong’s story
        much the same way the Resident Evil 4 Remake itself did for Leon
        Kennedy. The relatively short four-hour runtime leaves very little room
        for the action-packed adventure to make a misstep, and it never does:
        levels are familiar but feel new, encounters and boss fights are
        reworked and fantastically varied, Ada’s grapple gun abilities feel
        right at home alongside the remake’s new features, and surprises wait in
        store even for die-hard Resident Evil fans who think they’ve seen
        everything. As modestly sized DLC expansions go, it’s hard to ask for
        much more than this.
