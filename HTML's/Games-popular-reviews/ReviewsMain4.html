      </span>

      <p>
        It’s been almost a year since I reviewed Pokemon Scarlet and Violet at
        launch, and I still feel more conflicted about them than any other
        Pokemon game in all my years loving the series. They dazzled me with
        their open world design, which felt like the answer to years of fan
        requests – but the performance and aesthetic hits that came with that
        innovation were painful catches that didn’t quite feel worth the trade.
        Still, with two DLCs on the horizon, I had hope that Game Freak would be
        able to pull it together. Could the first DLC, The Teal Mask, fix
        Scarlet and Violet’s glaring issues and deliver a robust, new experience
        that fully embraced the clear potential of what these games could have
        been?
        <br /><br />
        Nope!!!
        <br /><br />
        For starters, I don’t know how it’s possible, but somehow The Teal Mask
        runs worse than the base game of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet does. I
        complained about the poor performance of Scarlet and Violet in my
        initial review, and had hoped that a whole year later Game Freak would
        have made improvements to things like framerate, pop-in, weird lighting
        issues, model clipping, and everything else – problems Nintendo even
        stated it was working to address back in December. But it hasn’t.
        Instead, it feels like the DLC has the jankiness turned up about one or
        two more notches.
        <br /><br />
        It’s still playable: I didn’t run into any game breaking bugs. I did
        suffer from one hard crash, which while not a huge deal due to the
        game's frequent autosave, is still pretty shocking given the franchise's
        relatively polished history. But more importantly, during my playthrough
        of The Teal Mask it was impossible to go for more than a minute or two
        without a visual distraction. Maybe my Tinkaton was clipping through the
        ground during battle, or falling into the abyss when an encounter
        started on a cliffside. Maybe I was watching nearby Pokemon models
        vibrate violently, or seeing NPCs vanish in and out of existence. Or
        maybe the whole thing was just chugging, simply because I was riding on
        my Miraidon and it didn’t know how to handle more than a few trees
        appearing on screen at once. Look, I don’t expect high-fidelity graphics
        at the level of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X in my Pokemon games.
        But the sheer amount of issues is so distracting all the time that it
        became an active detriment to my enjoyment. And if Game Freak keeps up
        its current pace of making performance several degrees worse with each
        game, by the next gen or so Pokemon might be literally unplayable,
        because you won’t be able to see anything. Fingers crossed that The
        Indigo Disk DLC this Winter improves matters literally at all.
        <br /><br />
        I don’t want to keep harping on the performance issues, but one more
        critical note on this point is that my problems with endgame raid
        battles from the original review still haven’t been fixed, which
        tangibly impacts gameplay. Queuing into online raids is still
        inconsistent due to the very weird way in which Scarlet and Violet
        refreshes its available raids and doesn’t notify you when they’re full.
        And once you do get in, completing high-level raids can be challenging
        due to lag and a weird timer system sometimes skipping your turn,
        freezing your screen, or otherwise making it impossible to tell what’s
        going on at any given moment. While some major raiding bugs have been
        fixed in the last year, it was impossible for me to spend time on the
        primary endgame content of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or its DLC without
        running into this stuff and being frustrated by it.
      </p>
      <h2>Kitakami feels like a massive letdown.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet/e/ea/Teal_mask_art.jpg" />
      <p>
        My feelings about the new Kitakami island region itself aren’t much
        fonder. Like Paldea, the world of Scarlet and Violet’s DLC is butt-ugly,
        with low-res textures, little detail in its environments, and a single
        town mostly made up of buildings you can’t enter and NPCs uttering
        boring, nothing phrases. That big local “festival” that the trailers
        hyped up? It’s just a few carts with vendors and some uninteresting
        NPCs. It’s even more of a disappointment when you consider that Kitakami
        is based on Japan – a nation that Game Freak has based multiple
        memorable regions off of before (Kanto and Johto). When I’ve already
        seen a Japanese-inspired world done in such loving detail in multiple
        Pokemon Games, Kitakami feels like a massive letdown.
        <br /><br />
        That said, The Teal Mask isn’t all bad. The battling and competitive
        aspects are still what they’ve always been (good), and it’s still fun to
        fill up a PC box full of neat little dudes you find running around
        outside. The island checks all the boxes for that activity specifically:
        it’s big, full of Pokemon, and has lots of different biomes to poke
        around in. One of my favorite parts of Kitakami was the mountain at its
        center with crystalline pools at the summit, numerous caves along its
        path to the top, and a surprising cavern structure within full of
        Pokemon hiding around corners and in little holes. But the overall
        ugliness and performance issues did detract from locations that looked
        like they were probably quite beautiful in their concept art, just not
        their final execution – such as when I first laid eyes on those
        sparkling pools on the mountaintop, or when I crossed a thin, stone
        bridge to a mysterious cave as the sunset hit the surrounding rock
        formations.

      <h2>
        The plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists
        coming.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://www.ggrecon.com/media/vpvnhtil/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-hidden-treasure-area-zero-teal-mask-indigo-disk-cover.jpg?mode=crop&width=682&quality=80&format=webp" />
      <p>
        Content-wise, The Teal Mask largely consists of a familiar Pokemon
        formula where you track down a legendary Pokemon while learning about
        local lore. You’re accompanied on this quest by a sibling pair, Carmine
        and Kieran, both of whom spent most of the story alternating between
        yelling at me over nothing and challenging me to battles. The Teal
        Mask’s plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists
        coming, which is a pretty big bummer after the heights reached during
        the ending of Scarlet and Violet. This DLC campaign is also short, about
        seven or eight hours long, though catching every newly-added monster
        will stretch it a bit more.
        <br /><br />
        The best part of Teal Mask’s story is the subplot surrounding a
        photographer, Perrin, who sends you on a Pokemon Snap-esque photography
        journey after a totally different legendary Pokemon. After hours of
        Carmine and Kieran shouting at me, Perrin’s curiosity and backstory with
        photography were a refreshing change, and her photo-taking minigame
        provided a natural avenue for The Teal Mask to expand on something I
        loved in Scarlet and Violet: discovering Pokemon doing fun Pokemon
        things in their habitats. Frankly, Perrin’s story is so much more
        interesting than the rest of the DLC that it’s a shame I couldn’t spend
        more time hanging out with her and her Hisuian Growlithe instead of
        being dragged around by the world’s most unnecessarily angsty preteens.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Ogre Oustin’ is boring, repetitive, and runs terribly (especially
        online).
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pokemon-scarlet-violet-is-the-teal-mask-dlc-worth-it.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Other new features in The Teal Mask include an expanded Pokedex with a
        tiny handful of new monsters, a middling selection of new cosmetic
        choices, and a terrible minigame called “Ogre Oustin’” that involves
        tanking your framerate further by speeding around on your bike to
        collect berries really fast. While I’m always happy to praise Game
        Freak’s Pokemon designs (especially the candy apple-themed Dipplin –
        cute!), and it’s nice to finally change out of my hideous school
        uniform, I don’t know what they were thinking with Ogre Oustin’. It’s
        boring, repetitive, runs terribly (especially online), and yet made me
        feel bad about not wanting to play it by offering great rewards for
        anyone looking to build raiding or competitive teams. Terrible.
        <br /><br />
        The ways in which The Teal Mask feels like a step backward from what
        made Scarlet and Violet astonishing are also disappointing. Scarlet and
        Violet themselves promoted player freedom: you could go anywhere you
        wanted at almost any time, and do the major plot points in any order.
        The Teal Mask mysteriously tosses that in the bin in favor of a far more
        standard, linear journey. While you can explore any part of the island
        at any time, there’s no benefit to doing so beyond catching Pokemon. You
        can’t even do the initial quest – which involves visiting three sign
        boards around the island – in any order. The sudden loss of that player
        freedom is painful given how critical it was to my enjoyment of the base
        game.
        <br /><br />
        It’s also a surprisingly weak effort when compared to Game Freak’s
        previous DLC attempts in Pokemon Sword and Shield’s Isle of Armor and
        Crown Tundra. While both of these DLC were similarly criticized for
        being shallow in the story department, Isle of Armor added challenge by
        forcing you to train a brand new Pokemon, while Crown Tundra included
        multiple new game modes. The Teal Mask does… none of that, and feels
        distinctly incomplete. Maybe that’s because it was always meant to be
        just one half of a package with The Indigo Mask, but if that’s the case,
        then I question the wisdom of splitting the DLC at all.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        I just don’t know what to say anymore! I love Pokemon. I love catching
        monsters, and exploring, and filling a Pokedex, and harnessing the power
        of love, friendship, and adventure and all that. But The Teal Mask is
        yet another step in a slow quality downslide for this series: it runs
        terribly, looks ugly, feels predictable, doesn’t offer any of the
        freedom Scarlet and Violet’s main story did, and falls short in so many
        ways compared to just about every other Pokemon game and DLC I’ve
        played. If you’re considering The Teal Mask because you thought Scarlet
        and Violet were fun and just want more Pokemon, sure, this DLC will give
        you that. But as someone who was hoping The Teal Mask and a year of
        polish would turn things around for the ninth generation of Pokemon, I
        am sorely disappointed.
