      <p>
        Odds are good you’ve seen Mario stomp a goomba or kick a koopa shell
        before, but you might not have seen him punch a giant lady with a parrot
        for hair right in the shins while she sips a cocktail and rides a
        floating banana. Super Mario RPG is easily one of the quirkiest
        adventures the mustachioed plumber has ever been on, rightly becoming a
        standout when Final Fantasy developer Square first released it nearly
        three decades ago. Its 2023 remake is an incredibly faithful recreation
        of that already awesome RPG, with a fresh coat of paint and some small
        but smart combat updates. Those changes can’t completely shake off 27
        years of dust, but they do provide a fantastic way for fans like me to
        revisit this classic while also letting new folk better enjoy just how
        wild it is firsthand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bucking the usual setup, this entertaining story kicks off with Mario
        rushing to Bowser’s keep and immediately rescuing a kidnapped Princess
        Peach – but before they can return home happily ever after, a giant
        sword with a face crashes through the castle roof and sends all three of
        them flying. From there, Mario has to fight lots of living weapons up to
        no good and collect seven Star Pieces in order to save the Mushroom
        Kingdom. It’s not a long tale, taking me just about 12 hours to finish
        (though I’ve done so on SNES before), but the writing is so consistently
        funny and often off-the-wall that this essentially-unchanged script
        still had me frequently laughing out loud.
      </p>

      <h2>It's easy to see why this combat system influenced so many games.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://images.nintendolife.com/79aa1d52605d2/super-mario-rpg-nimbus-castle-walkthrough-3.large.jpg" />

      <p>
        Super Mario RPG’s turn-based combat is extremely straightforward,
        pitting your party of five against all sorts of weird and creative
        enemies – from your standard Mario monsters like goombas to the skeletal
        corpse of a mastodon that has literally zero explanation. It fuses
        timing-based button prompts into your otherwise recognizable mix of
        basic attacks and resource-limited spells, satisfyingly giving you an
        extra boost for a well-timed A-press on offense and reducing damage (or
        even negating it entirely) on defense.
        <br /><br />
        This system still rocks, and it’s easy to see why it influenced so many
        games that came after it – be that Mario’s own RPG outings in the Mario
        & Luigi and Paper Mario games, or more recent successors like the South
        Park RPGs or this year’s Sea of Stars. That said, it’s worth mentioning
        that while it’s always very fun, combat is also borderline comically
        fast a lot of the time, sending you into super-easy fights just as
        quickly as you’re likely to finish them, with the really interesting
        encounters reserved for a fairly wide array of inventive bosses. That
        includes a strange sort of dog monster that creates clones of your party
        members, as well as a living bow who cleverly disables buttons on your
        controller to prevent specific types of moves, shaking battles up nicely
        even if they still don’t usually pose much of a threat.
        <br /><br />
        Combat is also definitely the place this remake has been altered most
        substantially, largely for the better. Button timings now give an even
        bigger bonus for a super-precise press, even adding a splash damage
        effect to your basic attacks that made me more thoughtful about how I
        distributed damage in standard encounters than I ever was in the
        original. Chaining together well-timed presses also fills up a gauge to
        use on powerful new Triple Moves, each of which comes with an awesome 3D
        cutscene. These updates don’t necessarily make the combat feel as modern
        or as deep as many of the games inspired by the original, but they do
        help breathe plenty of fresh life into a system that certainly benefits
        from it.
        <br /><br />
        One part of that system that is still a ton of fun is its varied
        selection of weapons. Rather than only being a statistical increase, the
        weapons each of your party members use are tailored specifically to
        them, and their animations – and, as a result, attack timings – change
        whenever you find a new one. Mario could be kicking a koopa shell or
        smashing baddies with a hammer, while the totally lovable “tadpole”
        Mallow can go from swinging a stick to crashing together cymbals. Bowser
        (who rounds out your party alongside the mysterious Geno and Princess
        Peach herself) has probably the best weapon option: a glove that lets
        him pick up and hurl Mario as a projectile like Colossus tossing
        Wolverine.
      </p>

      <h2>The weapon variety for each character is still a ton of fun.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        I loved that each time I switched weapons I had to retrain my muscle
        memory, which is made easier here by a smart new prompt that guides your
        timing only until you nail it a few times (and then comes back if you
        start to slip). The rub of this extremely amusing weapon system,
        however, is that you don’t have much control over it. This is a very
        linear game, and each new weapon you find will almost always just be
        statistically better than the last, with no comparable alternatives to
        choose from. That’s true of your defensive items too, leaving the RPG
        part of Super Mario RPG a little bit thin as you don’t really customize
        your characters much past a single accessory slot for things like small
        stat boosts or status resistances.
        <br /><br />
        Instead, the lifeblood of this campaign is its variety – it’s easy to
        enjoy some fairly simple combat and progression when you’re never in the
        same setting long enough to ever come near getting bored. You’ll jump
        from classic Mario sewers to a ghost-filled sunken pirate ship, from a
        minigame where you’re barrelling down a waterfall collecting coins to
        one where you’re running up a hill trying to save Princess Peach, from
        fighting a crazed bomb person to a living wedding cake. This world could
        so easily have crumbled into a hodgepodge of disparate ideas, especially
        when you occasionally remember that this is somehow still a Mario game,
        but instead they come together to make a strangely coherent and
        delightfully unique whole.
        <br /><br />
        All of the things I mentioned and more have been lovingly recreated with
        true 3D graphics faithful to the original’s pre-rendered 3D art style,
        and the new look is… I dunno, it’s fine. I don’t mean to undersell what
        this remake has done, it really does look quite nice, especially in its
        brand-new and often super-cool cutscenes – but I can’t help but feel
        like some amount of the original’s personality has been lost in the
        translation here. Models and environments are updated almost one-to-one,
        leaving them looking shiny and new, but removing some of the charm the
        pre-rendered look naturally had. When I look at other Switch remakes,
        like Link’s Awakening or Live A Live, I end up wishing this one had
        found a bit of its own flavor inspired by that SNES look rather than
        just making the closest approximation it could manage.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The music is perfectly reverent while adding impressive new layers.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        One area that has been masterfully modernized, however, is the
        soundtrack. Super Mario RPG’s music has been burned into my brain since
        childhood, and while the rose-tinted glasses that come with that
        adoration initially had me thinking the updated versions were just okay,
        all it took was swapping between new and old (which you can conveniently
        do at will in the menu) for me to appreciate just how great these new
        tracks are. They are perfectly reverent while adding impressive layers
        of instrumentation and nuance to every song, capturing their spirits and
        all the little accents that make them so catchy while bringing something
        new to the table in the exact way I wished the graphics had.
        <br /><br />
        And speaking of new, this isn’t just the adventure oldies like me might
        remember. The base campaign has remained relatively untouched in terms
        of content, but an entirely new post-game lets you explore for secrets
        you may have missed after the credits roll, while also including some
        impressive extra challenges to push your limits. Avoiding any specific
        spoilers, that includes extremely clever twists on some fights that
        require a deeper use of the combat system and its various mechanics in a
        way I appreciated. I sort of wish these encounters hadn’t been saved
        exclusively for an endgame grind, but I like that the added difficulty
        is there for those left hungry by the main story.
        <br /><br />
        There’s also a comprehensive Monster List to fill out, with checkmarks
        and funny little quotes for every enemy you manage to successfully time
        Mallow’s Thought Peek ability on, giving me a completionist goal to
        chase even as combat got overly easy. However, this list exposes perhaps
        the most surprising issue with Super Mario RPG’s remake: about a third
        of the way through the campaign, the menus started suffering from
        serious framerate drops that made everything from shops to equipment
        juggling to that exhaustive Monster List a chore to navigate. I didn’t
        run into any technical issues besides this (apart from some similar lag
        in one specific map area), but it was bad enough that I actively
        disliked managing my party, checking my items, or revisiting all of
        those silly quotes I had collected, which is a bit of a bummer.
      </p>

      <h3>Verdict</h3>

      <p>
        Super Mario RPG is considered a classic for a reason, and this
        wonderfully faithful remake makes it easy for anyone who missed it in
        the SNES era to see why. It’s unabashedly odd, reveling in the
        unexpected with writing that constantly had me bursting out laughing at
        jokes I’d heard a dozen times before. Its turn-based combat is fairly
        simple outside of its very clever boss fights, but it’s also ultra
        satisfying to keep your timing string going even when you’re plowing
        through pushovers. And while the updated graphics are equal parts pretty
        and sort of unambitious when it comes to interpreting the original’s
        style (with some unfortunate menu lag), the new takes on its excellent
        music are truly exceptional. Super Mario RPG already held up pretty well
        if you didn’t mind a bit of dust on its different systems, but now
        there’s no excuse not to see why Mario’s most unexpected adventure is
        still so beloved.
