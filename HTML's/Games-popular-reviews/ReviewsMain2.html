      </span>

      <p>
        The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria might lovingly depict one of the
        most recognizable fantasy worlds ever created, but to my surprise,
        that’s not actually the most recognizable thing about it. This is a
        survival game first and a Lord of the Rings game second, content to
        replicate all the familiar mechanics of the genre while leaning heavily
        on its Tolkien backdrop to compensate for a lack of original ideas. If
        you’ve played any survival game in the last 15 years, you’ll immediately
        know what you’re in for as you build bases, cook food, upgrade your
        pickaxes to mine better ores, craft armor and weapons to fight hordes of
        enemies, and run back home when it gets dark. The trouble is there’s no
        part of the tried-and-true survival blueprint that Return to Moria does
        better than games that came before it, and there are some parts, like
        the terrible combat and constraining building, that are significantly
        worse than most.
        <br /><br />
        Return to Moria’s story takes place during Middle-earth’s Fourth Age,
        after the fall of Sauron and the conclusion of the War of the Ring – an
        interesting choice, since this era has not been explored much at all in
        the canon. Everyone’s favorite dwarf and occasional projectile, Gimli
        (who is once again voiced by movie trilogy actor John Rhys-Davies), has
        called all the dwarf factions back to Moria in order to reclaim it from
        the goblins and orcs who have taken over. As one of those summoned
        dwarves, you and up to seven friends are sent into the menacing bowels
        of the lost kingdom to cook rat meat, decorate hastily assembled hovels,
        and juggle dozens of materials between haphazardly placed chests like
        the unrepentant hoarders you are.
        <br /><br />
        After an opening cutscene that throws you into a dark hole, the story
        slowly builds to a confrontation with a powerful entity that’s corrupted
        Moria with dark magic. That said, most of that story is little more than
        a series of excuses to reference the events of Fellowship of the Ring,
        like when you find the stone Pippin threw down the well or walk through
        the room where Frodo’s Mithril saved him from an otherwise-fatal blow;
        just about every other room finds a way to remind you that the
        Fellowship traveled through here. It’s not that the story is bad
        overall, and I can forgive a certain amount of fan service in a Lord of
        the Rings game, but the larger issue with it is that you spend about 95%
        of the journey, which took me nearly 45 hours to complete, jogging
        through dark corridors and beating up irritating goblins, so it’s easy
        to forget there’s any kind of plot to follow to begin with.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Occasionally. it reminds you you’re in Middle-earth in endearing ways.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/23/lotr-return-to-moria-blogroll-1698097339833.jpg" />
      <p>
        Occasionally, though, it reminds you you’re in Middle-earth in endearing
        ways – namely through song. If you’ve ever read a Tolkien book then you
        know the man could only go a few pages before he felt the insurmountable
        urge to lay down a beat, and I love how much Return to Moria pays
        tribute to that legacy. While mining all manner of ore, your dwarf will
        start singing from a wide library of light-hearted songs. If you get
        drunk with your comrades, you’ll all start dancing and singing some epic
        ballad about your people’s history. And during key story moments, you’ll
        break out some especially stirring songs filled with lore and a whole
        lot of heart. That is, if you aren’t interrupted by a sudden emergence
        of goblins and orcs trying to kill you in the middle of your musical
        number, as I was a number of times.
        <br /><br />
        The main thing Return to Moria gets right is the almost rhythmic pattern
        of gathering more and better resources to feed your growing
        base-building needs. That loop of exploring deeper and deeper into a
        dangerous mine filled with monsters as you collect resources and improve
        your character can be entertaining. While at first you can get by with a
        dusty pickaxe and sword, you’ll quickly find yourself outmatched by
        enemies further down in the darkness, and therein lies the fun. You’ll
        need to acquire rarer raw materials, upgrade your gear, and improve the
        accommodations at your base to make the going easier, like a very
        necessary keg filled with beer to maintain morale. It’s easy to get lost
        in the continuous grind as you aim for the latest shiny thing that’s
        going to enable you to brave the next leg of the journey. This loop will
        be very familiar to anyone who’s stayed up too late running around in
        Minecraft or slaying giant spiders in Grounded, so we’re not exploring
        new territory here, but it’s extremely important that Return to Moria at
        least retreads that ground well.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The actual building, combat, and especially exploration all miss the
        mark.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://img6.fresherslive.com/latestnews/2023/10/will-the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-launch-on-steam--653756a7ab25f43431380-1200.webp" />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the actual building, combat, and especially exploration
        that come along with that generally enjoyable grind all miss the mark,
        and all for the same reason: a shocking absence of freedom. While you
        can set up a base from scratch almost anywhere, each new zone has at
        least one or two preset campsites that are extremely beneficial to use
        as starting points, making it very difficult to justify dumping a bunch
        of resources into making camp anywhere else. And even when I did decide
        to go rogue and settle down in a place of my choosing, most of the time
        the building options were so frustratingly finicky it made me regret the
        undertaking. In one case I spent half an hour trying to build a second
        story for my base that kept collapsing due to some unspecific rules
        regarding load-bearing structures, and in another I immediately realized
        the area I’d chosen was diagonally oriented on Return to Moria’s
        grid-based map, meaning every single structure I placed was chaotically
        incompatible with the layout of the room. It really feels like the
        designers did everything they could think of to prevent you from
        creating your own settlements, which is certainly a strange set of
        priorities for an adventure that’s literally all about rebuilding Moria.
        <br /><br />
        Even worse is combat, which is a very dull pattern of blocking,
        stabbing, or shooting arrows with only a few weapon types that feel far
        too similar, which is a major ball to drop since Return to Moria has you
        doing a whole heck of a lot of it. Goblins, orcs, and uruks spawn all
        over the map whenever you’re not looking, raise an army against you
        whenever your mining and exploration create too much noise, and assault
        your bases with intent to destroy them on a regular basis. Many of these
        encounters can last 15 to 20 minutes, as dozens and dozens of identical
        cretins surround you and continuously respawn for a painful amount of
        time. Fighting is largely not difficult, since the enemy AI is some of
        the most facepalmingly incompetent I’ve ever seen, but with large health
        bars and regular incoming attacks that had me dodging and blocking more
        than I had the opportunity to attack, it drags on for far too long.
        <br /><br />
        And when I say enemy AI is bad, I really can’t understate it. Enemies
        constantly get stuck on top of and inside their surroundings, allow you
        to stand at a safe distance and pick them off with ranged attacks, and
        repeat the same attacks over and over again, letting you spam the same
        response a dozen times before they finally go down for the count. Every
        once in a while you get a new enemy type like a drake or a troll to
        contend with, but even these fall victim to terrible AI, quickly casting
        any excitement straight into the fires of Mount Doom.
      </p>

      <h2>When I say enemy AI is bad, I really can’t understate it.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        Also, I also feel the need to mention just how annoying the enemies are.
        They never stop screaming like maniacs and, even if you’re not in their
        immediate vicinity, you can hear them hooting and hollering nonstop.
        After more than 40 hours of that, I felt like letting out a psychotic
        scream of my own.
        <br /><br />
        Return to Moria also makes the perplexing choice of not actually letting
        you mine in any direction you want, instead putting up hard,
        impenetrable barriers wherever you go, and only allowing you to dig
        through laughably small hallways that connect one area to another. No
        Man’s Sky and Ark have longevity because there’s no end to the ways you
        can make the world your own, build creative and interesting bases, and
        express yourself. Return to Moria has bafflingly little of that. Even
        mining is limited to small deposits found on the sides of the mine’s
        halls, providing a shallow deposit to be carved out before hitting
        another impenetrable barrier. It’s just wild to play as a dwarf in a
        mine without being able to actually dig through… basically anything.
        <br /><br />
        On the bright side, all the areas you encounter along the way have a lot
        of personality to them, from the Elven Quarter filled with trees and
        beauty, to some gross depths covered in glowing mushrooms and clouds of
        poisonous corruption. Highlighting one of the only ways Return to Moria
        differentiates itself from its peers, traveling through this underground
        kingdom’s linear path feels like a proper Lord of the Rings adventure.
        Even if very little of it stands out as particularly impressive, I still
        enjoyed the gratifying process of building up my base in an area,
        improving my gear, then packing my things and journeying deeper
        underground to see if I can survive what’s next. That does make the
        journey a bit more linear than your typical survival game, but in the
        tradition of Tolkien adventures that lead the heroes on a harrowing
        adventure from one part of Middle-earth to another, it just feels right.
      </p>
      <h2>
        One of the areas Return to Moria falls shortest is in its consistently
        poor performance.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        One of the areas Return to Moria falls shortest is in its consistently
        poor performance, from bugs like items disappearing, to issues like
        unstable framerates and abnormally long loading times. There are even
        extreme cases like how some areas fail to load before you get there,
        exposing developer objects like immersion-ruining walls separating two
        parts of the map that don’t disappear until you’ve gotten entirely too
        close to them. In fact, there are only a few cases where Return to Moria
        ever looks or performs well at all, and it seems to get worse when more
        players are added to a world, especially for the guests (since I usually
        played in my host world, my friends experienced even worse performance
        than I did).
        <br /><br />
        Performance aside though, Return to Moria is most definitely best when
        enjoyed among friends, as no Lord of the Rings tale is complete without
        a party of friends to share the adventure with. It might make things
        significantly more chaotic to have four or five friends in your world
        all breaking stuff and smacking around wolves, plus the need to feed all
        those mouths and craft enough gear to go around can add to the grind,
        but it’s very nice to even the odds in large combat encounters that go
        by much quicker with a group. Plus, it’s always handy to have someone to
        revive you or help you carry all the loot you don’t have room for in
        your backpack. But again, this is a case of the more, the buggier.
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        As a big fan of both The Lord of the Rings and survival games, I was
        enticed by the idea that I can dive into a genre I already know and love
        with the rich lore of Middle-earth to keep me company (as well as a
        party of friends), but it’s disappointing to see such a promising
        concept do little more than a barely passable impression of better
        games. Combat is dull and repetitive, owing to overused enemy types and
        braindead AI, and limited mining opportunities or freedom with
        settlement building throws a wet blanket over the creativity that’s
        typically a selling point for the genre. Throw in rough technical
        performance and it becomes difficult to recommend Return to Moria to
        even my fellow Tolkien stans. There’s a decent game in here somewhere,
        as the compelling progression loop and chaotic multiplayer capabilities
        can make for a really good time – I just can’t give you many reasons to
        pick this survival game over the plethora of better options when it’s
        only ever by-the-numbers at best.
