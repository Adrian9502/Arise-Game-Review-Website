      <p>
        Released in 1992 for the Commodore Amiga and then a year later on the
        Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, the original Flashback was so
        groundbreakingly cinematic that it was initially advertised as being a
        “CD-ROM game on a cartridge.” Sadly its long-awaited sequel, Flashback
        2, doesn’t break any new ground – but it does manage to break in almost
        every other way imaginable. Poorly presented, sloppily executed, and
        absolutely lousy with progress-stalling bugs, I’m not sure you could
        experience a Flashback more unpleasant than this even if you’d dropped
        all the acid at Woodstock.
        <br /><br />
        You wouldn’t know that it’s been 31 years since the original Flashback,
        partly since Flashback 2’s story runs concurrently with that of its
        predecessor and features a similar aliens posing as humans plot, but
        mainly because this disastrous side-scrolling sequel seemingly ignores
        every advancement made in game design over the past three decades. Basic
        collision detection? Responsive controls? Functional AI? Forget it.
        Flashback 2’s adventure feels heavily compromised in all facets right
        from the opening moments in its cyberpunk-tinged city of New Washington,
        and it only gets worse from there.
        <br /><br />
        In so many ways, Flashback 2 feels shockingly inferior to the original.
        In place of the cutscenes that bridged gameplay sections that remain
        striking to this day, we now get static talking head sequences with
        character faces so unremarkable that they may well have been
        collectively created in an afternoon by an AI art generator. Returning
        hero Conrad Hart was a man of few words in the original, but now he
        won’t shut up in Flashback 2, woodenly delivering dumps of exposition
        like he’s the narrator in a high school play. There are also some
        unintentionally hilarious story moments – like when a certain supporting
        character is abruptly killed off, only to return safe and sound in the
        next chapter like the instantly reversed demise of Chewbacca in The Rise
        of Skywalker.
      </p>
      <h2>Stupor Metroid</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, combat is theoretically more robust thanks to the spatial
        depth offered by the 2.5D level design, but fussy thumbstick-based
        targeting makes fights against larger groups of enemies woefully
        imprecise, and any attempts at stealth are futile since every guard
        seems to have eyes in the back of their heads. I also found the
        30-second timer on the use of weapon power-ups to be rather impractical,
        and more often than not I’d pick up the mortar rounds or heavy pistol
        ammo in the last few seconds of a fight, then be forced to waste them by
        pointlessly firing at walls since I couldn’t carry them into the next
        scrap.
        <br /><br />
        Additionally, the added depth to each area introduced an inherent
        clumsiness that had me regularly getting stuck on the edges of doorways
        or staircases, stumbling through solid objects like they were holograms,
        and eventually just falling directly through the floor and trapping
        myself in out of bounds areas that forced me into checkpoint restarts.
        You know it’s a bad sign in an action game when you spend just as much
        time reloading saves as you do your pistol.

      />
      <p>
        Playing on PlayStation 5, I’d occasionally come out of one of Flashback
        2’s surprisingly lengthy loading screens only for everything to stay
        black, even though I could hear the ambient sounds of the world and my
        own footsteps as I aimlessly wandered around in the dark until I
        reloaded. In another instance my gun just stopped working in the middle
        of a firefight, despite the fact that Conrad’s pistol is blessed with
        infinite ammo at all times. So once again I had to reload my save,
        except this time my gun continued to fail at the exact same moment, and
        did so over and over again with each subsequent attempt as my
        frustration mounted.
        <br /><br />
        Eventually I decided to brute force my way through that particular
        confrontation with heavily armoured guards and bots using a liberal mix
        of medkits and Conrad’s feeble and thoroughly uncoordinated melee
        attacks, which given the overwhelming odds stacked against me
        unsurprisingly led to my first proper death in Flashback 2. That led me
        to stumble on one of the most bizarre design choices of all: You see,
        Flashback 2’s Game Over screen somewhat confusingly features two very
        similar options; ‘Resume’ and ‘Continue Game’. If you choose to
        continue, a list of your previous manual and checkpoint saves pops up
        for you to load from, which is more or less what you’d expect.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Anytime you get killed you can always get straight back up and walk it
        off like you just lost a lounge room NERF gun battle.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        However, if you choose to resume, then Conrad just magically comes back
        to life on the spot with almost a full health bar, no questions asked.
        That effectively neuters every enemy threat in Flashback 2, and both the
        collectable medkits and Conrad’s rechargeable shield are rendered almost
        entirely unnecessary since anytime you get killed you can always get
        straight back up and walk it off like you just lost a lounge room NERF
        gun battle. It’s enough to make your average Dark Souls fan suffer a
        case of the vapours.
        <br /><br />
        To be clear, this isn’t merely a feature of Flashback 2’s easiest
        difficulty setting, and you can trust me when I say that because
        Flashback 2 doesn’t actually have any difficulty settings. It just
        defaults to resurrection mode, almost as though the developers were so
        acutely aware of how likely it was to break that they added the resume
        function in a desperate attempt to keep Flashback 2 propped up on its
        feet like the corpse from Weekend at Bernie’s.
        <br /><br />
        Slow pacing infests all of Operation Deadbolt, but it does the most
        damage to the story. There's a linear tale to uncover here, but unlike
        past Zombies campaigns, it's not hidden away in puzzles and Easter eggs
        you need to discover on the map. Instead, it's all deployed through
        uninspired, MMO-like mini-objectives, like using a Pack-a-Punch to power
        up a gun and then killing 50 zombies with it. Complete enough of them
        and you'll get to play dedicated story missions, but there's a huge
        amount of tedious stuff to get through before you can even see what
        Operation Deadbolt’s plot is about — it took about two dozen hours for
        me to grind through enough to access the first one, which I still
        haven't played due to a bug.
      </p>

      <h3>Block to the Future</h3>

      <p>
        Rising from the dead like an unstoppable terminator can only get you so
        far, however, as I found out roughly five hours into Flashback 2’s
        story. Despite the many bugs and consistently low stakes combat, I’d
        still managed to slog my way through the uninspired story sections that
        have been rehashed from the original campaign, and in most cases made
        worse. The Running Man-inspired Death Tower game show has been swapped
        out for a clumsy mech battle that offers all the tactical depth and
        precision of a worn-out set of Rock ‘em Sock ‘em robots, while a return
        trek through the Titan Jungle region is made to be infinitely more
        painful due to the presence of a companion character who straight up
        refuses to follow you at times.
        <br /><br />
        However, my progress ground to a complete halt when I found myself
        trapped inside a boss fight arena with no actual boss to fight, and no
        way to cheaply “resume” my way through it. After my umpteenth loading of
        a prior save game, I retraced my steps and discovered the reason – the
        hulking monster that was supposed to chase me down and confront me in a
        subterranean cavern had gotten stuck at the top of a flight of stairs,
        seemingly hesitant to take any further steps down like ED-209 at the end
        of the original RoboCop. What followed was a positively ludicrous
        scenario in which I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, as I tried to
        push and prod the beast down the stairs and into the boss fight arena,
        with it stubbornly refusing to comply – a bit like trying to get your
        cat into the carrier when it knows full well that you’re trying to take
        it to the vet. All the while the objective at the top left corner of the
        screen said ‘Escape the creature’. I guess… I was the creature now?
        <br /><br />
        Still, after wasting an exhausting couple of hours trying I could not
        force this fight-fearing freak into battle, and it was only after
        Flashback 2 received its first post-release patch that the creature
        magically appeared inside the boss fight arena and I was able to
        confront it – and yet it still wouldn’t take me on! Instead it just
        marched on the spot up against the far wall of the arena, unable to
        escape and completely unwilling to fight. It was clear that the
        electrified pools in the middle of the area were intended to be used to
        shock the monster to death, but since I couldn’t bait it into attacking
        me and thus lure it into an electrified demise, I just shot it. And shot
        it. And shot it. In fact, I kept the trigger held down for well over
        half an hour, as I emptied a John Wick movie’s worth of ammunition into
        its conflict-avoiding arse without a health bar or any form of visible
        damage to clue me into how close, if at all, it was getting to death.
        <br /><br />
        Eventually, after taking a break to ice my cramping trigger finger and
        check my sanity, I considered a different approach, which was to
        position myself between the monster and the wall he was forlornly
        plodding against and sort of herd him towards the electrified death
        traps using melee attacks, which was harder than it sounds since
        Conrad’s punches and kicks are about as easy to land as a plane with no
        wheels. However, the good news is that this method eventually brought
        the beast to an electricity-charged end, and I was able to continue
        Flashback 2’s story.
        <br /><br />
        The bad news is that not 10 minutes later I had reached another
        progress-stalling bug, this time involving a special battery I had
        retrieved from the facility with the peace-loving boss monster. When I
        tried to return the battery to the village leader who had originally
        tasked me with collecting it, his response was to instruct me to go and
        retrieve the very same battery, trapping us in some sort of recursive
        Abbott and Costello-style comedy routine with no way out. It certainly
        seemed ironic that despite the fact the battery was in my inventory, I
        found myself completely powerless to progress beyond that point, and I
        had to set Flashback 2 aside entirely for several days before a second
        post-release patch eventually remedied the bug (while at the same time,
        making that quest-giving NPC invisible).

        Flashback 2 is also plagued by sustained framerate dips so severe that

        sloppiest form of stop-motion.

      <p>
        I’m relatively happy to report that I didn’t hit any further
        game-breaking glitches beyond that point and was subsequently able to
        complete the story after about 10 miserable hours, but I’m sorry to say
        that doesn’t mean the remainder of Flashback 2 wasn’t still rife with
        control problems, forced restarts, characters and enemies that blink in
        and out of existence, and frequent animation glitches, all culminating
        in a calamitous final boss encounter that was about as well constructed
        as a barbecue assembled by Homer Simpson. Throughout, Flashback 2 is
        also plagued by sustained framerate dips so severe that at times I
        wondered if the developers had deliberately forgone the stylishly
        rotoscoped animation of the original in favour of the sloppiest form of
        stop-motion. The original Flashback was heavily inspired by Arnold
        Schwarzenegger’s Total Recall, but the closest Flashback 2 will ever get
        to a Total Recall is if publisher Microids inevitably has to issue a
        total recall on every copy sold.
        <br /><br />
        It’s particularly disappointing because I look back on 1992’s Flashback
        with genuinely fond memories, and with its 1995 follow-up Fade to Black
        transporting Conrad’s adventures into a full 3D game world, I’ve long
        yearned for a Flashback sequel that more closely resembled the
        side-scrolling original. But unfortunately this is very much like
        copping a middle finger from the Monkey’s Paw, and not too dissimilar to
        spending 30 years wishing for a new movie that features the original
        Ghostbusters cast, only to be forced to uncomfortably sit through the
        decidedly off-putting appearance of a CGI’d ghost of the late great
        Harold Ramis in Ghostbusters Afterlife. Flashback 2 is similarly
        ill-advised and equally lacking in soul.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        While the original Flashback is an Amiga classic, Flashback 2 can only
        be described as a meagre sequel. Rehashed story elements, dull and
        clunky combat, a shockingly modest presentation, peculiar design
        decisions, and wholly unacceptable technical deficiencies (the bulk of
        which persist even after two post-release patches) make for an adventure
        that left me underwhelmed at best and utterly infuriated at worst. While
        I’ll always feel nostalgic for Conrad Hart’s original adventure,
        Flashback 2 is unfortunately not the blast from the past I had hoped for
        – instead, it’s a total misfire.
