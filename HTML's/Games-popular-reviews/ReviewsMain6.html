      <p>
        It’s been a hot minute since the last time we were able to pile bunker
        an enemy mech in the face, but the team at From Software has finally
        returned to their roots with Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. It
        certainly looks and feels the part of a modern mecha action game, with
        gorgeous graphics, a rock-solid 60fps frame rate that never falters, and
        an intuitive control scheme that dramatically reduces the learning curve
        we had to deal with in prior Armored Core games. At the same time, its
        bland mission briefings and a few elements of its design feel a bit
        stuck in their old ways. But Armored Core 6 scores direct hits in the
        spots it matters the most: specifically the highly customizable,
        intense, and frantic mecha battles.
        <br /><br />
        If there’s one area where Armored Core 6 could have benefited from more
        modernization, it’s in its storytelling. The five-chapter campaign plays
        out almost entirely over radio conversations, PowerPoint
        presentation-style mission briefings, and combat chatter that is nearly
        impossible to pay attention to while you’re fighting for your life on
        the mining planet of Rubicon. It doesn’t help that our character is a
        blank slate who just does whatever they’re told, fighting on behalf of
        corporations, resistance forces, arms dealers, or the enigmatic Walter
        and his personal agenda. As a result, despite an interesting setting and
        premise with plenty of teases of ulterior motives and questionable
        loyalties, I found it hard to really connect with the story on anything
        beyond a pure surface level, which is a shame because one of the major
        ideas of Armored Core 6 is a branching storyline that has you making
        decisions on which faction you want to take on missions for. I just
        didn’t really care one way or the other.
      </p>
      <h2>The Puzzle of Combat</h2>

      <p>
        However, one of the benefits of this mission structure is that it’s able
        to allow for a wide variety of objectives that each favor a different
        style of play, which then feeds into the excellent customization
        elements that make up the heart of Armored Core 6. Before you sortie
        into a mission, you’re able to equip your mech with four weapons — one
        for each arm and one attached to each shoulder — a unique head, body,
        legs, generator, booster, and Fire Control System. And oh boy, are there
        a ton of different factors to consider beyond simply what to spend your
        limited money on.
      </p>

      <h2>
        There are a ton of different factors to consider beyond simply what to
        spend your limited money on.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The external parts of your mech all have their own weight, defensive
        value, AP (health), and what’s known as Attitude Stability, which
        affects how quickly you get staggered from consecutive hits. Parts with
        higher defensive stats naturally weigh a lot more and require sturdier
        but slower leg parts in order to carry the burden, and weapons that
        weigh a lot require larger, stronger, and heavier arm parts.
        <br /><br />
        But that’s not all! Certain weapons also take a ton of energy to wield,
        and thus require generators that have large EN (energy) capacities in
        order to even equip them. But then you have to balance that with the
        fact that your energy regeneration could suffer, which means energy
        management gets much more difficult once you’re actually in the mission.
        Before you even start making those decisions you should consider what
        range you expect your mech to be fighting at so you can optimize your
        internal parts for that role… and the list just goes on and on.
        <br /><br />
        That may sound like a lot, and I’m not gonna lie: it is. But still, I
        felt like Armored Core 6 did a great job guiding me with its sorting
        tools and descriptive text, which made it easy enough for me to discern
        what parts were good for what. As long as I had the idea in my head of
        what kind of mech I wanted to make, it was fairly easy to bring that
        idea to life. Over the course of the campaign I piloted a lightweight
        scout with fast boosts that excelled at evasion, a medium-sized
        destroyer that could wield heavier weaponry without sacrificing too much
        mobility, and a mobile fortress outfitted with the heaviest and most
        devastating weapons money could buy – and several in between.
        <br /><br />
        What all of this customization amounts to is making every mission feel
        like a satisfying combat puzzle. Even though there are certainly
        loadouts that felt stronger than others (hello dual kinetic shotguns on
        a medium sized bipedal mech), there was never a one-size-fits-all
        solution to every mission, which is a testament to the stellar design
        and variety of the missions themselves. You’ll never do the same thing
        twice. One mission had me investigating a seemingly abandoned outpost,
        only to be ambushed by stealth ACs that I needed to scan in order to
        target; another had me dropping down into an underground facility,
        carefully descending from platform to platform so as to avoid getting
        disintegrated by the laser cannon at the bottom; and another still had
        me infiltrating a cave to destroy a generator, which I did, and then had
        to book it out of there to avoid getting caught up in the resulting
        explosion. It kept the action fresh throughout the entirety of the
        15-hour campaign and beyond.
      </p>

      <h2>There was never a one-size-fits-all solution to every mission.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img src="https://static.bandainamcoent.eu/high/armored-core/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/00-page-setup/acvifor-header-mobile-new.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Failing missions is part of the process, and it's something that will
        very likely happen to you a lot. But fortunately the checkpoint system
        is fairly generous, and you’re given an opportunity to change the
        assembly of your mech after every death. This made it so that every
        failure came with an opportunity to assess what went wrong, and think
        about how I could fix it. Coming back with the right answer, whether
        that was simply by switching out my weapon or a more drastic revamp
        involving changing up my AC archetype, was always satisfying. That said,
        I really wish that you could also access the shop as well when you die.
        If you don’t already have the thing you need to beat whatever you’re
        stuck on, you have to back out of the mission, buy it, and then restart
        from the beginning.
      </p>

      <h2>Get in the Robot</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        One of the things that I appreciated right out of the gate in Armored
        Core 6 is that I was able to pick up the controls extremely quickly.
        It’s all very intuitive: Right and left triggers fire your right and
        left arm weapons, right and left bumpers fire your right and left
        shoulder weapons, X jumps, square dodges, circle toggles your booster
        jets, clicking in the left stick makes you go into a sprint-like assault
        burst mode, and clicking in the right stick changes your lock-on mode.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve seen a lot of discussion from longtime Armored Core fans who are
        not happy about there being a hard lock-on system, with the argument
        that it lowers the skill ceiling, but I think From Software has found a
        really delicate balance with it. If you turn on the targeting-assist
        mode you gain the advantage of keeping the camera fixed on a specific
        target, but you’re less accurate with your shots. As a result, I found
        myself switching between the two modes frequently – using the
        targeting-assist mode so I wouldn’t lose track of a fast-moving boss,
        and then switching it off and manually keeping it in my sights when I
        felt like It was time to counter-attack. Having the hard-lock also
        allows for some really dynamic and intense boss fights that would’ve
        been much more frustrating to deal with if I didn’t have a way to always
        keep the boss in my sights.
      </p>
      <h2>Armored Core VI Screenshots</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />

      <p>
        More than anything, though, combat in Armored Core 6 just feels good.
        The wide assortment of weapons all feel satisfying in their own way,
        whether that’s using a charged shot from a linear rifle on an unaware
        enemy to kill them in one shot, nimbly dashing around with dual shotguns
        and laying waste to a whole military base, or juggling quad rocket
        launchers between your arms and shoulders. Things can feel downright
        anime-like at times with how many missiles you’re able to fire at once –
        and with how many missiles get fired at you.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to the regular missions, there’s an arena mode that pits you
        against steadily increasingly difficult one-on-one fights against named
        ACs, each with their own unique loadout and assembly. You’ll definitely
        want to go through them too, as completing arena fights rewards you with
        currency you can use to strengthen your mech and further customize your
        playstyle. You could increase your damage with a specific type of
        weapon, increase your defense, unlock core abilities like a
        super-satisfying kick out of your assault boost, and much more. Better
        still, you can respec at any point for a fairly modest fee. If you wanna
        test your arena skills against actual humans, you can do that as well,
        in both 1-on-1 and 3-on-3 online matches. I didn’t get to test out the
        netcode extensively in my review period, but the few matches that I did
        play were super smooth and a ton of fun.
        <br /><br />
        And of course, if cosmetic customization is your thing, there’s a ton of
        options to paint your mech whatever color combination you desire, place
        a variety of decals you unlock through arena fights, create your own
        custom decals, then save and share your creation with the rest of the
        world.
        <br /><br />
        Beating Fires of Rubicon’s campaign unlocks a New Game+ mode that allows
        you to take all of your unlocked parts through the story missions again
        from the very beginning. There’s also a lot of incentive to play through
        NG+ in the form of multiple endings, new story branching points,
        entirely new and more difficult missions, and even a whole new set of
        arena matches to fight through. Needless to say, you’ll definitely want
        to go through this more than once to get everything that AC6 has to
        offer.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Armored Core 6 doesn’t look to reinvent the bipedal legs of the mech
        action genre, but it does update, refine, and polish them to an
        aggressive shine. Every sortie is a satisfying combat puzzle to solve
        thanks to fantastic mission design, intense boss encounters, an
        extremely wide assortment of weapons and parts that can dramatically
        affect how your mech plays, and excellent, explosive combat that manages
        to take very complex systems and mechanics and make them easy to
        understand and execute. Its interesting premise is stifled by bland
        storytelling told through mission briefings and radio chatter, but this
        is still nonetheless a welcome return of a classic mecha series.
