      <p>
        The very same weekend we received Bluey: The Videogame, Australia’s ABC
        broadcasted a countdown of the top 100 Bluey episodes, as voted by the
        public. Tuning in for the final 20-or-so, it was the perfect opportunity
        to catch up with any of the very best ones I’d managed to miss over the
        years ahead of this review. One of those was Onesies, and I was floored
        when the theme was revealed. Seriously, the ability of this children’s
        show to tackle a concept as complex as infertility for an audience of
        any age, and with such an expert balance of levity and empathy, is
        nothing short of remarkable. There is so much to this show beneath the
        surface. I do wish I could say the same about Bluey: The Videogame –
        that it, too, is quite remarkable in its own way. Unfortunately, it is
        not. It may look like a spot-on recreation of Bluey’s gorgeous and
        distinct 2D animation, but beneath the surface there isn’t much more
        than an hour or so of mild multiplayer fun and moderate frustration.
        <br /><br />
        As I’ve touched on, Bluey the show is a rare breed; colourful and cute
        enough to entertain its core audience of preschoolers, witty enough to
        hook older kids and deliver valuable lime lessons without ever
        patronising either audience, and regularly profound enough to make their
        parents cry. On a more superficial level, though, it’s rare because it’s
        also beautifully animated in 2D. While I admit I probably don’t quite
        have my finger on the pulse of pre-schooler TV these days, if it’s still
        anything like it was a few years back this is in stark contrast to most
        shows for four-year-olds – which tend to look like time capsules of PS1
        game cutscenes exhumed from 1997.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Bluey: The Videogame does an admittedly terrific job of emulating the
        bright and chunky look of the show.
      </h2>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        Bluey: The Videogame does an admittedly terrific job of emulating the
        bright and chunky look of the show, and it effectively converts the four
        available backdrops into 2.5D environments that bring depth to places
        like the Heeler home without jarring with the show’s usual look (which
        is typically staged on a single plane). The characters and animations
        are equally accurate, and they’re more or less indistinguishable from
        the show itself. It helps a lot that the cast is also aboard to provide
        the voices.
      </p>

      <h2>For Real Life</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, that’s largely where the good stuff stops. Perhaps the
        biggest problem of all is the absurdly short length for what isn’t some
        two-dollar tablet game you download on a whim to keep a toddler busy
        while you’re waiting for your spring rolls. At £35 in the UK, $60
        Australian, and $40 US, it is brazenly expensive for a game that can be
        completed in under an hour, and picked clean of collectables in less
        than two. We try to keep price out of the conversation in a review
        because games don’t get better when they go on sale, but exceptions must
        be made in cases like this where it’s just a ripoff.
        <br /><br />
        There are just four maps – the Heeler house and backyard, the
        playground, the creek, and the beach – and a short story arc split into
        four 10- to 15-minute episodes. Developer Artax Games has divided the
        Heeler backyard and house in the menu to make it appear there are five
        maps, but that’s not the case; obviously, the house and backyard are
        connected. It is a tiny amount amount of extremely modestly sized maps.
        No shops, no succulent Chinese restaurants, no school, no Hammerbarn –
        it’s the bare minimum all the way.
      </p>
      <h2>It just doesn’t actually feel finished.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The setup is cute enough; it’s the school holidays and Bluey and Bingo
        are spending it on the hunt for a forgotten treasure buried by Bandit
        and his brothers when they were kids. As such, there are appearances by
        Uncle Stripe and Muffin, Uncle Rad, plus Chilli’s father Grandad Mort.
        There’s even a low-hanging moral brushed against in the fourth and final
        episode, which culminates at the creek, but then the story just… ends.
        The beach is unlocked, but there’s no story component here – even though
        there feels like there should be. It just doesn’t actually feel
        finished.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ad72a6318-fc8e-43e1-942c-a077079aba5b?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=1440&dpr=1"
      />
      <h2>Gotta Be Done</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        It doesn’t feel particularly well-finished when it comes to how it
        plays, either. I played through in co-op with my kids and our experience
        was mostly fractured, finicky, and frustrating. There were times our
        characters were frozen and only returning to the character screen to
        re-select our characters would fix it. Lining up objects to interact
        with and pick up is a hassle, which is doubly annoying considering the
        solution to every puzzle is pushing or pulling a piece of furniture. Or
        maybe a rock.
        <br /><br />
        Platforming is imprecise and inelegant in the 2.5D spaces, and while it
        does seem to only need one of you to succeed, this is a pain in groups
        of three or four players. In bigger groups, progression is messy – it’s
        really just a melee of everybody spamming the interact button to gather
        junk and getting teleported along by the first person to successfully
        make a few jumps.
        <br /><br />
        Each of the four episodes also introduces a separate minigame that can
        be started and played from a dedicated game wheel, including Keepy Uppy
        (keeping a balloon off the ground, which is dreadfully underwhelming in
        practice), the platforming-based Ground is Lava (which had a habit of
        trapping me in a glitched state where I couldn’t move), Magic Xylophone
        (which is basically freeze tag with an extraneous musical instrument),
        and Chattermax Chase (which is essentially Baby’s First Oddball. You
        kids know what Halo is, right?).
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, these minigames are scrappy and rudimentary at best, and
        we really didn’t find ourselves drawn back to any of them. If anything,
        we gleaned the most fun out of exploring the Heeler home in free-roam
        and hunting through all the recognisable rooms, but even that was short
        lived.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It’s a bewilderingly unimaginative take on the most canny, creative, and
        considered kids show I’ve ever seen.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <img
        src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6927256.1691096233!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bluey.jpeg"
      />

      <p>
        With 151 episodes of Bluey in the can, the list of places and pooches
        Bluey: The Videogame could’ve featured is extensive. What we have feels
        like barely half a game. It’s a bewilderingly unimaginative take on the
        most canny, creative, and considered kids show I’ve ever seen, and it’s
        extremely trifficult to recommend.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Wedged somewhere between Wi-Fi and The Wiggles as one of Australia’s
        greatest exports, Bluey has been a staggeringly successful animated
        series. Tens of billions of minutes of the show have been streamed into
        households in more than 60 countries, and the Heelers have subsequently
        been transformed into over 1,000 bits of merchandising tat. In an
        unfortunate turn of events, Bluey: The Videogame feels a lot like
        another forgettable piece of the latter, hovering somewhere between the
        countless toys and the tubes of licensed toothpaste. Low on innovation
        and high on what feels like contractual obligation, Bluey: The Videogame
        is really a low-effort mobile game masquerading as a mid-price console
        and PC product. It may absolutely look the part compared to the show
        itself, but with its assortment of shallow minigames rife with annoying
        bugs, frustrating controls, and a bafflingly brief runtime of a little
        over an hour, everywhere else it’s a dog’s breakfast.
