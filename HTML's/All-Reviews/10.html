      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        Were you one of the handful of people who not only played Call of Duty:
        Infinite Warfare, but actually enjoyed it? Fear not, no judgement here.
        I too was one of such a minority. Despite its many issues and numerous
        flaws, the Zero-G shootouts and space-based combat had me enthralled.
        ‘Boundary’, a new first-person-shooter from Studio Surgical Scalpels and
        Skystone Games, is all of the thrills of that combat system, with none
        of the extra frills like a campaign. Or fine tuned balancing, for that
        matter.
      </p>
      <h2>The Last Frontier, To Shoot</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Boundary is a multiplayer space-themed first-person shooter. It’s
        literally as simple as that description. Four short tutorials will teach
        you the basics of gunplay, using equipment and most importantly,
        traversal. Given that space has a distinct lack of gravity, Boundary
        plays rather differently to your typical FPS, to its undoubted benefit.
        <br /><br />
        Jumping into a match, you’ll immediately notice how much you’ll float
        about, knock into structures unexpectedly and end up aiming upside down
        at a similarly lost opponent. The developers have done an admirable job
        translating intergalactic floating into satisfying FPS mechanics.
        Traditional sprinting is replaced by a burst of O2 launching you in a
        specific direction, recovering from shots is thematically replaced by
        repairing ruptures in your suit and you can use button inputs to barrel
        roll in either direction.
        <br /><br />
        The gunplay feels tight and incredibly responsive which is fantastic
        given it’s still in Early Access. Assault rifles will spray bullets in a
        tight formation while a heavy machine gun will send miniature
        soon-to-be-asteroids into the vacuums of space. Landing shots takes a
        decent amount of skill, as knowing where to aim and accounting for
        travel speed will mean the difference between the best players, and
        abject failure.
        <br /><br />
        Mechanically, Boundary is super fast-paced. Combat encounters are
        frequent and firefights rage like a matchstick meeting an aerosol can.
        If you thought strafing was bad in other games however, this game
        smashes the previous bar by how far circle strafing can carry you
        through engagements. It’s awful and kind of awesome at the same time,
        but it will be infuriating as you start your conflict in the reaches of
        space.
      </p>
      <h2>Modern Spacefare</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Before each match, you can select from up to six classes of combatant.
        They’re your typical fare: assault equivalent, sniper, medic, tank
        (called Fort), recon and stealth. Each class utilises different weapons
        and starting equipment. The assault class starts with an EMP grenade
        which disrupts enemies’ movement and controls, while Fort fires an ADS
        grenade that marks targets.
        <br /><br />
        Each class also has different stats for health, armour and
        maneuverability, making it an important choice for matching your
        playstyle. This becomes a more tactical decision when you factor in game
        mode selection, as Fort might be essential in Domination but useless in
        search-and-destroy equivalent Purge. It creates a nice dynamic across
        teams as you try to balance what your squad are bringing to the table.
        <br /><br />
        If there’s one issue with the system so far, it’s that snipers are
        dominating the choice selection from my experience. Not only are they
        capable of one-shot kills, thanks to there being literally no air
        resistance in space, they can thwack you from basically anywhere on a
        map. The map is also space – so that just means everywhere with a line
        of sight.
        <br /><br />
        There’s also some problems with balancing across teams. It’s common for
        matches to have lop-sided engagements, like in one match where me and
        one other player got repeatedly blasted by a team of 5 as Boundary
        refuses to rebalance sides mid-match. Moreover, if there’s skill-based
        matchmaking yet, it needs jettisoning out into the furthest depths of
        the universe. Some matches were so ridiculously unfair skill-wise it
        made playing it a chore. This may level out as the player count
        continues to rise, but right now, matches don’t always feel balanced.
      </p>
      <h2>Houston, We Need Some Content</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        With 7 maps and 5 game modes currently available alongside the 6 classes
        of astro soldier, there’s a semi-decent amount of spacefaring combat to
        be had. Having said that, every mode is a clear inspiration of
        variations you’ve played hundreds of times before in other FPS titles.
        From staples Team Deathmatch and Domination to Search and Destroy,
        Sabotage and a Rush/Conquest equivalent.
        <br /><br />
        For the most part, the modes are fun and serve their job. Map design is
        surprisingly interesting, thanks to the space station locations and 360°
        movement offering spacious vertical and horizontal layers. A couple of
        objectives, particularly on Domination and the rush mode feel imbalanced
        towards one team which needs some fine-tuning. While there were
        bottle-necked objective locations in places, these were actually
        thrilling, creating tense rampages and moments for the kind of organic
        chaos only multiplayer FPS’ can fathom.
        <br /><br />
        Yet, after a couple of hours of playing and having a great time, the
        lack of maps, modes and even weapons or equipment started to become
        noticeable. Of course, this is going to be improved a lot between now
        and Boundary’s full release, but this feels more like an introductory
        promise of the game that is to come. If you truly love the mechanics,
        there’s at least half a dozen or so hours of potential enjoyment here,
        but I can see many bouncing off quite quickly until more content is
        introduced.
        <br /><br />
        To its credit, the progression systems in the game are quite strong. You
        level up your overall rank while playing any class, but you also gain
        levels for XP garnered with specific weapons and soldier types. Levels
        unlock a host of new cosmetics, guns, equipment and there’s more
        promised too. Boundary features a “pick 10” type customisation system
        whereby you can mix and match weapons, attachments and equipment up to a
        maximum of 20 points, which really incentivises experimenting and
        tinkering.
        <br /><br />
        As with most Early Access titles, Boundary is missing that content depth
        to really maintain its longevity as a viable FPS alternative at the
        moment. However, the mechanics, progression and gunplay are solid enough
        to make it worth trying if you’re very much into the genre.
      </p>
      <h2>Space Is A Wonderful Place</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        If there’s one thing a space-themed video game needs to nail, it’s the
        sense of atmosphere (ed – or lack thereof) and the aura that the
        infinite void holds. Boundary smashes through this like a black hole
        meeting matter. Graphically, the lighting shimmers across every surface,
        background planets loom over the engagement arena with impetus and the
        tracers from bullets flare across the pristine space stations you’ll be
        navigating.
        <br /><br />
        It’s truly beautiful, to the point that I actually died a couple of
        times from stopping to marvel at the technical prowess on show. Dynamic
        elements like being able to shoot through glass solar panels and
        swooping your way into interior corridors via ducts add a grounded
        realism to an otherwise out of this world experience.
        <br /><br />
        Given that this is space, audio cues are kept to a minimum, with the
        kind of beeps and muffled noises you’d hear directly from the ISS’ own
        transmissions. There’s very little, if any, musical score here and while
        the lack of epic backing track sometimes feels amiss at the climactic
        end of a match, I think it’s a justified concession to maintain the
        thematic loneliness and vastness of space itself.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        I also ran into a couple of bugs – one where my game locked up at the
        start of a match and another involving clipping into a particular wall
        which was bothersome. The biggest issue it needs to address is region
        locking, owing to getting some ridiculously awful pings from other
        players, creating scenarios where I’d quite clearly be blasting their
        suits apart only for me to somehow end up drifting lifelessly into
        space. Oh, and the matchmaking, please fix that ASAP.
