      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat
        unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier
        Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing
        CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem
        like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more
        detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And
        for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke
        grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's
        movement and gunplay.
        <br /><br />
        Still, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the
        foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm
        confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.
        <br /><br />
        For your average Counter-Strike-enjoyer, CS2 will seem more like a large
        CS:GO patch than a sequel eleven years in the making. Sure CS2 is
        powered by Valve's newer Source 2 engine, with a slew of smaller tweaks
        to menus and bigger tweaks to the way grenades work. Ultimately, though,
        it's still terrorists versus counter terrorists where budgets wax and
        wane depending on how many heads players have dinked in their
        crosshairs. Hop into a game of CS2 and it'll feel very, very similar to
        CS:GO. It's to be expected right? CS2 was always going to elevate a
        winning formula and not like, introduce wall running and a perk system.
        <br /><br />
        Transitioning from CS:GO to CS2 is easy peasy, as all of your settings
        and binds port over, alongside all your cosmetics. As a returning
        player, I had no problem hopping into CS2 and finding my feet quickly,
        which deserves a big thumbs up. Unfortunately for newcomers, the game's
        still poor at guiding you towards useful things, like tweaking your aim
        sensitivity or adjusting your crosshair or even what any of the modes
        actually entail. Guides or an experienced mate are likely necessities if
        you're feeling a bit overwhelmed, so CS still has some growing to do on
        the tutorial front.
        <br /><br />
        I'd say your mileage may vary if you're playing Casual matches, as
        they're still a chaotic mass of bodies and grenades that offset the
        intricacies of bomb defusal, but hop into Deathmatch, Competitive or the
        new Premier mode and CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike so damn
        crispy. As much as guns have personality and it's satisfying when you
        land your shots, CS is about question and answer, both in response to
        your teammates' dots as they scurry about the map, as well as the sudden
        cracks of gunfire that break long periods of silence. Are you covering
        your allies' blind spot? Is it time to rush B no stop? Yes and
        absolutely 1000%, yes.
        <br /><br />
        And if we examine the small changes more closely, they do play a more
        significant role in making match admin a bit easier. The flexibility of
        the new inventory means you're able to curate your weapons pool with a
        drag and drop, so you can finally have both CT assault rifles available
        in the buy menu if you'd like (I am giddy). And the buy menu's been
        updated, so as your teammates purchase guns in-between rounds, little
        dots underneath each weapon's portrait help you see everyone's loadout
        at a glance. There's even a handy refund button to undo those slip-ups
        or ease last minute hits to the bank account.
        <br /><br />
        It's on the surface where the game's most obvious change lies. Step into
        any map and it'll appear brighter and more colourful, with dark corners
        abolished in favour of visibility. Step into Mirage's palace and there's
        a proper sheen to the marble floor, the monster graffiti in Overpass now
        wraps around the tunnel with a mighty splash, and I'd spend my Steam
        Points on a long weekend at Inferno's apartments because they're
        gorgeous now (noise might be an issue, but we compromise). Gone are the
        days of walls with the texture of hummus and I'm here for it.
        <br /><br />
        On the slightly-less-obvious-until-you-sling-one-across-a-map scale,
        grenades are more reactive to their surroundings. In CS:GO, smoke
        grenades would generate a puff of static fog that wouldn't budge until
        it disappeared. But in CS2, fog will curve around an arch and spill
        outwards, or wedge itself into a narrow gap and shoot upwards like it's
        been pinched by the stone. What's neat is how explosions from regular
        grenades will dissipate smoke for a second, exposing any poor bastards
        hiding away inside. And if you shoot through the edges of a cloud, it'll
        bobble around your bullets and potentially expose enemies, too.
        <br /><br />
        Generally, I think the smoke grenade tweaks affect both your regular and
        serious players equally, as they're substantial enough to alter their
        most basic usage as quickly chucked sight blockers or entirely change
        how top players use them. I'm by no means a serious player and even I've
        found the new smokes awaken options that hadn't previously existed.
        Rather than waiting around tentatively for them to vanish or being
        surprised when someone erupts from the darkness, it finally feels like
        you're able to manipulate smokes inline with the rest of CS's sandbox.
        <br /><br />
        Despite some of these positive strides in maps and grenades, there's
        also a lot of goodness from CS:GO that hasn't found its way into CS2's
        launch. There's no Mac support. No Arms Race or War Games. No way in the
        console to go left-handed. Fan favourite maps like Cache and Train are
        absent. All of these will undoubtedly come with time, but it's
        frustrating that we can't go back to CS:GO and enjoy them because Valve
        snapped it out of existence. I don't blame players for thinking CS2 has
        "cut the game in half", as it sort of seems that way.
        <br /><br />
        There's also an argument to be made about how some of the maps like
        Inferno and Italy have been "overhauled" and what overhauled means for
        most people. For folks like me, most of the changes are about as
        perceptible as spotting a lobster with pink eye. Most of these tweaks
        involve shifting a ledge a few inches to the right, which serves the
        side of the community for whom minutiae matter. Again an example of how
        CS2's updates will seem more substantial to some and barely present for
        others.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Valve's still at it with loot crates you've got to pay to open and the
        dodgy marketplaces that orbit it. But I wouldn't say it's super in your
        face, as you can choose to not engage with it if you'd like. I basically
        do not care for any skins or crates or anything and the game doesn't hit
        me with pop-ups or punish me for tuning out. I'm not saying I like the
        whole gambling thing and I wish it didn't exist, but you're at least
        free to disengage.
