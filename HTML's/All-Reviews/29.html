      <p>
        With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of
        following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and
        heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question
        becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down.
        Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double
        down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted
        another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of
        the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other
        ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each
        other. The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the
        same fun as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world
        activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The
        result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably
        thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others.
        <br /><br />
        Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2’s combat is
        very familiar – it doesn’t have that new suit smell anymore, but it
        still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision
        dodges, the new perfect parries (so you’re not only swerving and
        striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is
        chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The
        movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut
        butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and
        elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies
        are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across
        concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling
        pins – but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be
        broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to
        commit crimes again.
        <br /><br />
        Overall, there’s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time
        than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the
        stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine,
        this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story
        missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out
        thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to
        get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up
        enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than
        spreading them out to pick them off one by one.
        <br /><br />
        A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber – which pulls
        enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another – also
        playfully builds into this philosophy. I had a lot of fun using this
        before landing a sharp burst of Miles’ Venom lightning onto grouped-up
        goons, and now Peter can get in on that fun as well. It takes a bit
        longer than I expected to arrive, but once Parker dons the symbiote suit
        already shown off in trailers, the gooey, angry powers that come with it
        make a big impact, adding more of a brawler nature to fights and giving
        Peter a set of tools to match Miles’ satisfying electric abilities.
        They’re just as enjoyable, as it feels like the suit is trying to burst
        out of the rumbling DualSense controller in my hands. This aggressive
        style of play is rewarded, as the only way to heal is by building up
        your focus bar – filled by landing hits and timing perfect dodges – and
        is another way to make sure that exciting rhythm of combat is never
        lost.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Spider-Man 2 offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        One area that Insomniac has made improvements in is that Spider-Man 2
        offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety, so you’ll no
        longer be battering the same five balaclava bullies with baseball bats.
        New factions and units, such as flamethrower-wielding cultists that keep
        you at a distance, flying drones, and hunters who deploy laser grids
        above your head to limit aerial attacks keep you on your sticky toes.
        Certain enemies are weak to different types of abilities, such as
        electric or symbiote attacks, which also adds an enjoyable extra wrinkle
        to fights. It’s by no means revolutionary stuff, but a welcome added
        level of complexity that makes you consider which powers – or even which
        Spider-Man – are best for a given job.
        <br /><br />
        That's not to say there aren’t benefits to taking a sneaky route,
        though, especially when you’re playing as Miles and using his
        invisibility power to quietly take out enemies. There are many perch
        takedown possibilities offered and new toys to play with too, such as
        the Web Line, which allows you to create your own highwires over your
        enemies to prey on them from above. It’s a fun tool that allows you to
        reshape the tightly designed arenas into a battlefield more in your
        favour, and in doing so, redecorate the room with web-wrapped people
        piñatas. On the other hand, much like combat, stealth isn’t a far cry
        from the many warehouse encounters you’ll have played in the previous
        games, as you clear out enemies using largely the same techniques.
        <br /><br />
        On the topic of covert ops, the playable MJ sequences from the original
        return, and while they are more involved this time around and serve the
        story well, they never add up to more than simple stealth missions or
        splashes of basic third-person shooting. She’s certainly not sidelined,
        but it does feel like a little more could’ve been done to make her
        gameplay sections a bit more exciting – or at least more in line with
        her established character as an intrepid investigative reporter than the
        missions she’s sent out on here.
        <br /><br />
        Combat aside, our Spider-Men can now swing around their friendly
        neighborhoods in more stylish ways than ever, with new spins and flips
        added to the repertoire providing a Tony Hawk-like edge. Performing web
        acrobatics is as gratifying as you remember, and still one of the best
        ways to get around any open world. The new web wings are undoubtedly a
        standout, however: like Batman before him, Spider-Man can now glide and
        soar with ease through the city, but not without limits – you’ll need to
        get the hang of managing your altitude and forward momentum, with the
        aid of windy corridors through the city that can quickly carry you from
        one district to the next.
      </p>

        The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn

      <p>
        The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn
        moments of reflection. It's undeniably a fun time to don the suit and
        enter a Kratos-like rage mode where you push in both thumbsticks and
        start one-hitting everything in your path, but the writers never once
        forget to take their eyes off of the humanity inside these superhumans.
        The same can be said for both its heroes and villains, as Spider-Man 2
        tackles the reasoning behind each character's actions and the good that
        can hide in the shadows of evil.
        <br /><br />
        For those with a hazy memory, there is a brief recap of both Peter and
        Miles’ stories so far available, which is handy, as this is very much a
        sequel that weaves in both plotlines and characters from the previous
        games and accompanying DLC. You won’t want to jump in for the first time
        here since Spider-Man 2 builds on the first two games both in its
        mechanics and its story – but of course, there’s little reason not to,
        since those games are also excellent. Avoiding spoilers, the basic
        premise revolves around Kraven the Hunter, who is, well, craving a hunt.
        For those uninitiated in the character, he's essentially The Predator,
        an Apex hunter blessed with super strength who has chosen New York as
        his next hunting ground. It's a great starting point that sends the
        city's hero and villain dynamic into flux as he sets his sights on the
        biggest prey possible.
        <br /><br />
        There are also smaller stories at play, though, ones that may seem less
        important when compared to city-wide chaos, but feel like potential
        world-enders to those who inhabit it. Both Spider-Men tackle the most
        extreme examples of trying to manage a work/life balance you can
        imagine, exploring a range of personal issues including strained
        relationships and loss that plague us as humans, no matter how
        superpowered we may feel. It's the best-written story in the series yet
        (if still a bit cheesy at times), with performances worthy of the
        script. It’s a real triumph that it manages to cover such a wide
        spectrum of themes without suffering from tonal thwip-lash. A
        particularly memorable mission under the dancing lights of Coney
        Island’s amusement rides is a highlight that manages to impressively
        capture the story’s essence and bottle up its emotional tension before
        emphatically smashing it.
        <br /><br />
        Primarily a Peter Parker story, Spider-Man 2 explores his relationship
        with MJ and the reintroduction of childhood best friend Harry Osborne
        into his life. It’s always compelling to watch him contend with which
        pieces of the past to leave behind and what future self he wishes to be.
        In some of the missions where you control normal, everyday Peter, I
        couldn't help but feel the Uncharted influence more than ever, both in
        the techniques it uses to tell his story and the show-stopping action
        sequences when he slips into the suit. No matter how hectic a scenario
        gets, though, he always has a quippy one-liner ready to be expertly
        delivered by actor Yuri Lowenthal.

        Miles still gets his time in the spotlight, however, and has some
        fantastic moments towards the end of the main campaign, even if some of
        the more interesting explorations of his Puerto Rican/African American
        culture are reserved for side missions. Obviously, what you take away
        from the story and its diverse cast of characters will be unique to you.
        On the surface, it's another thrilling superhero story packed full of
        surprises, cameos, and Easter eggs – but there are deeper meanings to be
        found here, too.
        <br /><br />
        Spider-Man 2, and to an extent all great Spider-Man stories, tackle
        themes of adolescence and puberty – a time of uncertainty for even the
        most normal of teenagers trying to control bodily fluids. We join Miles
        at this exact point in his life, with family ties straining, friendships
        facing fresh challenges, and life decisions of genuine importance being
        posed for the first time. Actor Nadji Jeter displays all the range
        needed for the role, continuing to excel as a younger Spider-Man
        maturing before our eyes. For Peter, these themes manifest in a much
        more physical sense. He's in his early twenties so has already navigated
        the difficult years that Miles finds himself in, but thanks to the
        symbiote suit, he's working his way through yet more bodily changes.
        <br /><br />
        This physical manifestation is also representative of mental health
        issues that have developed for each Spider-Man. Venom hangs over the
        main characters like a spectre of grief, drenching them in black as if
        in a state of mourning. The story does a great job at gently exploring
        these issues and how, when not healthily addressed, personal demons can
        eat at us and lead to people we care about being unintentionally caught
        in the crossfire of the anger and pain those feelings can produce.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, a hero is nothing without its villains, and Spider-Man's
        rogues gallery is almost unparalleled. Outside of the likes of Venom,
        Kraven, and Lizard seen in the trailers, Insomniac has kept many more
        cards hidden up its sleeve. I won't even hint at any of these except to
        say that Spider-Man 2 opens with a bang, offering up a sense of scale
        not previously seen in the series. It's an adrenaline-fuelled
        reintroduction to the series that tests how well you remember the
        combat, as well as providing a few new tricks. It's also the start of
        one of the new side-story villain threads that are optional, and while
        those don't offer anything overly new in terms of gameplay, they do add
        valuable extra scraps of story. They flesh out these villains, allowing
        fully formed characters to emerge where once they were merely
        one-and-done boss battle appearances.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A tale with miles of emotional depth that never once threatens to peter
        out.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Speaking of boss battles, that’s one area that takes a noticeable step
        up from our initial tangos with Kingpin, Vulture, and the rest. One of
        my criticisms of the first in Insomniac's series was how uninspired many
        of the showdowns felt, with their quicktime-heavy fights making a light
        impact. Improvements were made in Miles Morales, but here in the
        full-fledged sequel, boss battles really come to life. You're made to
        wait a little too long for them sometimes, but when they do arrive they
        never fail to excite. They are evolving brawls packed full of danger
        that put all of your skills to the test. Dodges and parries are key, as
        well as using environmental tools dotted around the arenas for your
        benefit.
        <br /><br />
        The latter third of the campaign essentially becomes a boss rush mode
        that will put the sturdiest of thumbs to the test – not necessarily
        because it ever gets too difficult, but because of the sheer number of
        times you’ll be hammering that Square button. These later stages are
        where the majority of Spider-Man 2’s thrills lay, however, as it really
        hits its stride late on, and emphatically wraps up a tale with miles of
        emotional depth that never once threatens to peter out.
        <br /><br />
        The main story took me around 18 hours to complete before I hit 100%,
        and the subsequent platinum trophy popped up to congratulate my efforts
        after 27 in total. To earn that precious trophy, you’ll be spending a
        lot of time mopping up the many, many side activities that Spider-Man 2
        throws your way – and while not everybody must or should do all of that,
        it’s a reminder that quantity doesn’t always equal quality. Despite
        whatever loftier ambitions the story may have, this is still
        unapologetically an old-school approach to open-world game design, and
        nowhere is this displayed more clearly than in its optional quests.
        <br /><br />
        To their credit, the way you can highlight side objectives by pressing
        the right stick is a welcome upgrade over mere icons on a map. Even
        without that, you can spot ominous clouds or glowing purple rooftops
        with the bare eye signaling activities are there to be found. This isn't
        a world that beckons exploration or discovery, necessarily, but it is a
        step in the right direction toward creating greater immersion and
        mercifully less time spent looking at the map screen.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It’s a bit disappointing to see Insomniac’s series stuck in time when it
        comes to its side content
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That being said, I can't help but have hoped for a few more flashes of
        Gotham City to make their way into New York. Something like the
        spontaneous shock of Manbat jumping at you out of nowhere went a long
        way to making Rocksteady's superhero open world feel more reactive than
        what we get here (even though it always cheated by finding ways to keep
        civilians off the streets). When you consider the evolution of
        open-world game design that the Arkham series took over the course of
        the trilogy, and its multilayered villain side quests, it’s a bit
        disappointing to see Insomniac’s series stuck in time when it comes to

        Standard open-world filler activities are here aplenty, and that’s one
        area where Spider-Man 2 hasn't moved with the times or shown ambition at
        all. Collectibles, photo opportunities, and rather basic street crimes
        are still here and, despite having a few slightly more interesting
        quirks this time around, they only very occasionally excite. You’ll
        regularly be stopping the same getaways with the same few button presses
        (the button-mashing from previous games is mercifully largely gone) or
        stopping a break-in by battering the same few goons. Granted, the
        additional enemy variety in play makes these activities take a little
        longer to get old than they did in the past, but that still isn't quite
        a strong enough twist to make prioritising photographing a couple of
        amateur cosplayers over saving a house full of people from a raging fire
        not seem ridiculous.
        <br /><br />
        Fun, quick side missions like helping a student ask their crush to
        homecoming or rescuing the Brooklyn Visions’ mascot from a rival school
        by solving a series of light and mirror puzzles add dashes of charm, but
        I'd love to see yet more life breathed into this world to match its
        visual splendor. These characters do add a bit more flavour to the world
        and its largely homogenous population of NPCs you’re clearly not
        intended to look at too closely.
        <br /><br />
        There are exceptions to the rule, however: there are a couple of more
        involved questlines that are much more nourishing, almost to the point
        of being a series of mini main plot missions. My favourite was The Flame
        questline, which begins with simply helping out the fire brigade, but
        quickly spins a layered and mysterious web. It's full of twists, turns,
        and surprises, like a great, short comic book run that separates itself
        from the rest of Spider-Man 2’s optional time trials and simple puzzle
        minigames.
        <br /><br />
        Rewards for completing these various activities vary, with some ranging
        from genuinely exciting story teases for what’s to come, to simply
        gaining some tech parts to upgrade your abilities with. The tasks are
        often so mundane and repetitive, however, that I did frequently question
        whether these small, congratulatory nuggets were worth the slog they too
        often turned out to be.
        <br /><br />
        All of this contributes to fighting back against crime in each district
        of New York, a city now twice the size of what we’ve seen before
        including the leafy residential roads of Queens and the bustling borough
        of Brooklyn. There are 14 unique districts, each with its own set of
        objectives to complete before you can unlock fast travel to that part of
        the map. Not making fast travel readily available is smart, and
        truthfully, I barely used it anyway as swinging and gliding around the
        city is so much more fun, even though the load times are nonexistent and
        the speedy, swooping camera effect of switching between Peter and Miles
        is very cool. Gliding is especially great for crossing long distances
        thanks to the numerous wind tunnels that carve their way through New
        York's seemingly endless grid of streets flanked by art deco
        architecture and modern mirror-like skyscrapers.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, if you’re going to be catching your ray-traced, 4K reflection
        (if you opt for the 30fps fidelity mode) in that glass so often, you’ll
        want to look your best. Fear not, because there are dozens and dozens of
        suits to unlock, with myriad colorful skins to pick from on each of
        them. From modern interpretations of classics to returning fan
        favourites, there are treats waiting for Spider-Man fans of all
        generations. They are now all pure cosmetics as well – a smart
        separation of form and function means picking the skills and abilities
        you equip are separate from your choice of suit.

      <p>
        In keeping with Insomniac’s track record, the music behind it all is
        stellar, with Miles' and Peter's respective signature tunes playing
        depending on who you're controlling. A highlight, though, is the theme
        that follows in Kraven's footsteps, which bears more than a passing
        resemblance to Howard Shore's Uruk-hai war march from The Lord of the
        Rings score. It soundtracks a world that looks stunning, even when
        played in performance mode at a stable 60fps as I did for most of my
        playthrough.
        <br /><br />
        In fact, Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel as a whole. From the
        near-instant load times, the ability to pinpoint a fast-travel location
        and be there in a second, atmospheric lighting, and crisp reflections,
        all of the pieces fit into place wonderfully – aside from the very
        occasional NPC getting stuck where they shouldn’t. I can't say that I
        noticed one dropped frame in my dozens of hours of playing. This allows
        Spider-Man 2 to shine in its most jaw-dropping moments – of which the
        main story offers many – as explosive action, sparkling electrical
        effects, and fittingly slimy symbiote gloop fill the screen.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is both
        blessed and cursed. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a
        Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to
        life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier
        themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and
        web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them
        comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate
        them to fun new heights. The part that feels like it actually needed a
        radical rethinking is the open world of New York City, which has been
        made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly
        repetitious side activities. But it’s safe to call this another
        thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet,
        and despite its open world falling short, it's a reliably fun superhero
        power trip. And, you know what? Screw it. It really did make me feel
        like Spider-Man, too.
