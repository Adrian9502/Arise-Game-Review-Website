        BY TRAVIS NORTHUP | POSTED: SEP 13, 2023 11:00 PM
      </span>
      <p>
        Since its gameplay reveal earlier this year, it’s been hard to shake the
        idea that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is essentially a Far Cry game
        with a sci-fi setting. That’s not an incorrect assumption for several
        reasons; this is a wilderness-set first-person game with plants to
        harvest, animals to hunt, outposts to assault, and items to be crafted.
        But during a recent two-hour hands-on I discovered that Frontiers of
        Pandora has a more interesting set of ideas built atop that Far Cry
        skeleton. I certainly never expected to put the controller down and be
        thinking more about Mirror’s Edge and Horizon: Zero Dawn than I was
        about the classic Ubisoft formula.
        <br /><br />
        If you’ve watched either of James Cameron’s box office-busting Avatar
        films, you’ll know the world of Pandora is a vast, knotted rainforest of
        towering trees, floating mountains, and bizarre plant life. The
        blue-skinned, cat-like Na’vi who call the planet home can gracefully
        navigate that jungle at speed, sprinting along branches and leaping
        between boughs. That’s exactly what you do in Frontiers of Pandora.
        Developer Massive Entertainment has effectively made a jungle parkour
        system that feels like a cousin of the freerunning in Mirror’s Edge.
        <br /><br />
        It begins with your Na’vi protagonist’s strong leap which boosts you up
        into and between tree branches. Handholds that are beyond your grasp can
        often be reached via trailing vines that lift you up like organic
        elevators. The ground is carpeted by helpful flora, such as bounce
        pad-like orange fungi and plants that emit a speed-enhancing blue mist.
        It wasn’t long until I began to recognise running routes through the
        rainforest – pathways of blue haze that led to vines, which linked to
        branch networks. Beyond those developer-plotted routes, a vast amount of
        what I saw was climbable, allowing for all manner of freeform approaches
        to your destination. And, despite lacking the ‘stickiness’ of Assassin’s
        Creed’s freerunning, I was able to get anywhere I wanted quickly without
        any frustrating falls. It’s genuinely impressive.
        <br /><br />
        The demo’s best example of this jungle parkour came in the quest ‘Take
        Flight’, which directly led to Frontiers of Pandora’s recreation of
        another Avatar staple; flying atop a pterodactyl-like Ikran. Before I
        could bond with one of these leathery-winged creatures I had to chase it
        up a mountain that formed a running challenge. The ascent chained
        together all the movement techniques I’d learned so far and interspersed
        stretches of climbing with light puzzles, such as having to find and
        touch a number of flowers to open a doorway. At the summit I was given
        my reward: an Ikran to call my own (You can name it a variety of
        traditional Na’vi names, but I opted for the more comedically mundane
        ‘Carol’.)
      </p>
      <h2>

        freerunning in Mirror’s Edge.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Much like a horse in Assassin’s Creed, your Ikran can be summoned at any
        time. Unlike a horse in Assassin’s Creed, you can do this while falling
        from a mountain peak. This is proper movie fantasy fulfilment; soaring
        through the skies, you’re able to weave between floating sky islands,
        nosedive along cliff edges, and fly into the sunset. Despite all that,
        I’m not quite as sold on travelling via Ikran as I am on the on-foot
        movement. It feels less dynamic and oddly sluggish compared to the more
        nimble ground systems, and flight controls are a touch awkward. I did
        enjoy performing explosive fly-bys against RDA Samsons, though – the
        enemy human helicopters that poison Pandora’s skies.
        <br /><br />
        As in the films, invading humans are the enemy in Frontiers of Pandora.
        When it comes to taking them out, there are two broad options:
        traditional Na’vi weaponry or modern RDA guns. They offer two different
        approaches; the silent Na’vi bows are best suited to stealth
        infiltrations while the loud human guns are for when all hell breaks
        loose. Not that the latter happened much; at least in this demo, the
        enemy AI was so braindead they barely reacted to allies dying right next
        to them. Combined with simplistic encounter design, most combat
        situations proved trivially easy.
        <br /><br />
        The humans ideally need to be smarter because they are squishy and thus
        can’t take much punishment, be that from your arrows or a swing from
        your fist (you are a nine-foot-tall cat person, after all). More
        competent bad guys will provide Avatar with a much-needed boost in
        challenge. Thankfully many of the humans are smart in a different way:
        they stomp around in protective mech suits. These are harder to destroy,
        but using your ‘Na’Vi sense’ will highlight a mech’s weak points such as
        the pilot, exhaust vents, or missile pods. This reminded me a lot of
        Guerilla’s Horizon games in which you scan mechanical beasts for their
        weak points and blast them off with arrows. And, just like in Horizon,
        you can craft different arrow varieties straight from the weapon wheel,
        refilling your quiver with suitable ammo on the fly. It feels a bit on
        the nose for Avatar to pilfer from the other Native American-inspired
        sci-fi with bows and mechs, but I can’t deny that this was the more
        satisfying side of the otherwise underwhelming combat.
        <br /><br />
        While I found humans dotted about the Pandoran wilds, my main encounter
        with them came at one of their industrial bases. This was a welcome
        contrast to the natural world; all sharply angled steel corridors,
        bulkhead doors, and concrete floors. Out in the jungle home territory of
        the Na’Vi I rarely felt in danger, but within the foreign,
        claustrophobic walls of this RDA compound my senses were constantly on
        edge. Crates, hidden vents, and overhead walkways provided simple
        stealth routes to avoid the guard patrols and stomping mechs, which
        posed more significant opposition here thanks to their increased
        numbers.
        <br /><br />
        My objective here was to sabotage several systems in an effort to bring
        RDA drilling operations to a halt. Doing so was fairly simple – nothing
        more complicated than pulling levers or dabbling in a bit of Watch
        Dogs-ish hacking – and so the real challenge was slinking between patrol
        gaps to do my work unseen. This was, more than anything in the demo, the
        most Far Cry-feeling element – a classic outpost takedown. But, thanks
        to that aforementioned contrast to the natural world, it didn’t feel as
        tired as you might expect.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Frontiers of Pandora is going to be instantly recognisable to anyone who
        has played a Far Cry game in the last decade.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This sort of traditional Far Cry work was a rarity, though. If the
        demo’s two hours are representative of Avatar as a whole, then a
        significant portion of your time will be spent doing more peaceful
        activities. The films’ natural world focus is represented here by an
        increased hunter-gatherer approach compared to Ubisoft’s other games.
        You need to frequently eat to ensure your health bar regenerates, so
        picking fruits and preparing meals with them is more central to the
        experience. Seemingly as a result of that, harvesting isn’t a single
        button-tap job; you must instead take hold of the fruit and rotate the
        analogue stick to find the right angle to pull from, similar to a
        lockpicking minigame. You can also hunt, but animals must be honourably
        killed with a bow; shooting Pandora’s wildlife with human bullets will
        spoil the meat.
        <br /><br />
        Among the side activities on offer were animals tagged by RDA darts,
        which had to be slowly approached and soothed before the needle was
        plucked out. This was all achieved by simply holding down one button and
        so didn’t offer all that much challenge, but I appreciate the thematic
        dedication to Avatar’s nature-loving soul. Similarly, I also found a
        huge rhino-like creature trapped in an RDA cage, and all it took was a
        few arrows to kill its captors and set it free. Hopefully the humans
        will put up better resistance in the full game, as otherwise these
        activities risk becoming box-ticking exercises.
        <br /><br />
        The other issue that I hope Massive will address before release is
        signposting. Pandora is a densely detailed world - an incredibly
        beautiful place that constantly reacts to your presence, decorated with
        a thousand things to see at any given time. That made finding very
        specific things something of a needle in a haystack situation – allied
        Na’vi characters often blended into the blue-hued environments, and one
        quest had me searching high and low for an item I had no way of
        recognising in the first place. Just a little bit more UI guidance in
        these situations would be appreciated.
        <br /><br />
        Structurally, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is going to be instantly
        recognisable to anyone who has played a Far Cry game in the last decade.
        But with its jungle parkour systems, flying mount, and increased focus
        on harmony with the natural world, it is at the very least making some
        notable changes to the formula. This certainly helps anchor it in the
        world of Avatar, but it remains to be seen if these additions will be
        meaningful enough to make the entire experience feel fresh. But, as
        someone who has grown very tired of this particular approach, I was
        happy to find that I left the demo session curious to see more of what
        lies among the trees of Pandora’s frontiers.
