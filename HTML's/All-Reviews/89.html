      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        In five years time when we discuss Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, there
        will be no confusion as to which of the two games that share that name
        people are referring to. Thanks to a lackluster story, fumbled
        mechanical innovations, and largely underwhelming mission design, this
        year’s Call of Duty campaign is an unfortunate misfire that fails to
        live up to standards set by not only its unforgettable 2009 namesake,
        but also its 2019 predecessor. While it is graphically impressive, the
        gunplay remains state of the art, and there are some welcome but
        all-too-brief attempts to tread new ground, Modern Warfare 2’s campaign
        relies too much on echoing the victories of Call of Dutys past rather
        than establishing its own triumphs.
        <br /><br />
        The six-hour campaign whisks you away from Call of Duty: Modern
        Warfare’s Middle Eastern frontlines and drops you into Mexico for the
        majority of its run. That’s thanks to the addition of the Las Almas drug
        cartel to the list of foes, who fulfill the exact same tired
        stereotypical roles that you’ve seen everywhere from Ghost Recon:
        Wildlands to Bad Boys. They’re heavily embroiled in a plot that involves
        an Iranian arms deal, stolen US missiles, and the interplay between
        multiple nations’ special forces. The quality of this story is a
        substantial step down from its predecessor; where Modern Warfare
        examined the human stories that emerge from military occupation and
        (lightly) assessed sacrificing a piece of your own morality in order to
        protect the civilian world, Modern Warfare 2 is more interested in
        broader, shallower action. The result is paper-thin, gung-ho characters
        and a conclusion that can be predicted from barely 30 minutes in. Expect
        less Kathryn Bigelow and more Michael Bay vibes for this chapter.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The quality of this story is a substantial step down from its
        predecessor.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That doesn’t mean there are not some more immediate, base-level thrills
        to be found while powering through that story, though. As ever, Call of
        Duty is on the cutting edge of graphics technology, and so looks
        incredibly handsome from practically every angle. While Mexico has
        plenty of lovely vistas, a brief visit to Amsterdam really demonstrates
        Modern Warfare 2’s graphical grunt thanks to impeccable attention to
        detail and gorgeous lighting effects.
        <br /><br />
        Likewise, as you’d expect from Call of Duty, the shooting is also pulled
        straight from the top shelf. Weapon handling is precise and punchy, and
        the visual, physical, and particularly audio feedback is in a league
        most FPS games can only dream of. Praise should certainly be laid on the
        sniper and assault rifles in particular, which feel the best they ever
        have. There’s a seemingly never-ending collection of weapons to pick up,
        each of which feels distinct in feedback and form, although rarely does
        the mission design favor one type over another to the point that
        different gun categories can feel interchangeable.
        <br /><br />
        Modern Warfare 2 doubles down on the smaller, more ‘realistically’ sized
        combat engagements of its predecessor. This makes for a Call of Duty
        campaign with a distinct rhythm; there’s much more methodical room
        clearing than there is taking part in large-scale, chaotic battles. This
        helps cement an identity for the rebooted Modern Warfare series, but
        comes at the expense of the intensity that has fueled some of the
        original games’ most memorable shootouts. I’d be more welcoming of this
        change if it weren’t for the addition of armored enemies, who must have
        their helmets or vests shattered before you’re able to land the killing
        blow. They initially feel like fun curveballs, but quickly become
        annoying bullet sponges that not only erode the efficiency of Call of
        Duty’s long-standing double-tap-to-kill approach, but also shatters any
        of the realism those smaller encounters are attempting to build.
        <br /><br />
        Mission design is, as you’d expect, admirably varied and often built
        upon a novel concept. Those that fall back on more standard templates
        feel underwhelming and often quite static, with multiple ‘hold the line’
        objectives and other such generic fare, although these are thankfully
        outnumbered by levels with better purpose. But while most of developer
        Infinity Ward’s campaigns have had a poster child mission (All Ghillied
        Up, No Russian, and Clean House to name just three), Modern Warfare 2
        struggles to make anything quite as memorable.
        <br /><br />
        Its best attempt is Alone, a stealth level in which you must escape a
        labyrinth-like town packed with guards. Starting completely unarmed, you
        gather materials and craft a variety of DIY tools – smoke bombs, trip
        mines, lock breaking gizmos – and use them to work your way to the exit.
        This has all the makings of a star Call of Duty mission, but is
        frustratingly undermined by the fact that your character is injured and
        can only walk at a snail's pace. It makes weaving between guard patrols
        a chore and its 40-minute duration seem like a lifetime. Elsewhere,
        there’s an unwieldy car chase that’s a poor alternative to Uncharted 4’s
        showstopper, and a brief-but-fun infiltration of a cartel boss’s mansion
        that has a (very) light Hitman touch about it as your disguised soldier
        rubs shoulders with enemies.
        <br /><br />
        But the majority of Modern Warfare 2 is content to relive past glories.
        There are two back-to-back missions that replicate the original Modern
        Warfare’s Death From Above, in which you rain down all manner of
        high-caliber ammunition from a circling gunship. Another sees you storm
        a cargo ship in an echo of Crew Expendable, while yet another is – of
        course – the copied homework of All Ghillied Up, right down to the
        hiding in the grass as enemies walk by. Then there’s the multiple
        references to 2019’s Clean House, which have you slowly walking up
        stairs behind two allies whenever the opportunity arises. It makes for
        something that feels a bit like a ‘Best Of’ album performed by a
        different, less confident band.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Recon By Fire demonstrates Infinity Ward absolutely has the ability to
        weave some choice into encounters.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That’s not to say there’s no merit or fun in these covers. The gunship
        missions demand much more precision than their inspiration thanks to
        targets often being close to civilians, and there's a more deliberate
        feeling in how you use each of the plane’s three ammunition types. Dark
        Waters, the cargo ship level, makes great use of moving cover as
        containers slip and slide across the wet deck. And Recon By Fire, the
        sniping mission, provides you with a backpack filled with various tools
        that provide a greater degree of tactical choice when it comes to
        clearing buildings. Will you breach the doors with explosives and fight
        inside, or drop a tear gas grenade down a ventilation shaft to force
        your enemies out into the open?
        <br /><br />
        I would have liked to have seen that backpack system used across the
        entire campaign. While I believe that Call of Duty’s strengths are
        firmly in linear scenario design, Recon By Fire demonstrates Infinity
        Ward absolutely has the ability to weave some choice into encounters.
        But it's sadly just one of a number of mechanics that feel included to
        be a momentary novelty rather than the basis of something richer. It’s
        joined by an armor plate system that’s used for a single mission,
        seemingly as a nod to Warzone rather than for any tactical benefit. Had
        both mechanics been woven into the fabric of the campaign as a whole,
        then the moment-to-moment could potentially have been elevated with a
        layer of micro decisions. Maybe that would have made fighting those
        groups of bullet sponges more pleasant.
        <br /><br />
        As a final note, Modern Warfare 2’s campaign is also a little buggier
        than I’d expect of a Call of Duty. Performance is consistently slick,
        but while playing on PlayStation 5 I have seen occasional texture pop-in
        on larger maps, and ugly low-res textures on some elements like water. I
        also encountered a save corruption bug at the final checkpoint of the
        last mission which triggered a hard crash every time it loaded, and so I
        was forced to replay the mission from the start. These are by no means
        game breaking, but are minor irritants all the same.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Call of Duty’s shooting is once again in a prestige class of its own,
        which means Modern Warfare 2’s campaign always manages to operate on a
        minimum quality bar that delivers a satisfying punch. But beyond each
        thunderous pull of the trigger is an underwhelming story and level
        designs that are too concerned with replicating the successes of
        previous campaigns rather than embracing its own good ideas for more
        than a single mission apiece. In the areas it does innovate it almost
        always stumbles, although there does remain some enjoyment to be taken
        in its momentary flashes of inspiration. Overall, though, this is sadly
        a lackluster follow-up to Modern Warfare 2019’s refined take on a Call
        of Duty campaign, and an experience that’s already fading in my memory.
