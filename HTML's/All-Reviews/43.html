      <p>
        I knew James Turner was up to something. He had previously announced on
        Twitter that he was starting his own game studio with a friend, and as
        TheGamer’s biggest Pokemon fan I follow what former developers are up
        to, especially Turner due to his role as Sword & Shield’s art director.
        It also helps that he posts the cutest illustrations on his Twitter
        feed. But I didn’t realise that his studio’s first game would steal the
        show at this year’s Devolver Digital Showcase.
        <br /><br />
        The Plucky Squire, the debut from Turner’s studio All Possible Futures,
        starts off as an adorable, if slightly cliched, adventure. Jot, our
        plucky protagonist, begins the trailer on a Link to the Past-esque 2D
        adventure within the pages of a story book. However, he soon finds he is
        able to escape from the pages and into the real, 3D world of a child’s
        bedroom. The art changes from two dimensional illustrations of Jot
        hopping over lily pads and battling bears, to something more akin to the
        style of the Link’s Awakening remake.
        <br /><br />
        I’ll start with the 2D levels, pre-twist, which are more interesting
        than I gave them credit for in the last paragraph, and have been
        overlooked by most people as they get excited about the 3D twist. The
        pages of the story book act like tiles in old school Zelda games, but
        the puzzles are very different. Dungeons appear to ape Mario more than
        Zelda with side-scrolling caverns, and there’s some sort of word game
        involved with the lily pads. Whether you have to collect words on your
        travels that will aid you to get to new areas or you can write freely
        remains to be seen, but at this point Jot is still confined to his story
        book, so I suspect it will be the latter.
        <br /><br />
        The bear boss fight switches from a top-down perspective to
        third-person, and the battle seems to be inspired by fighting games as
        you dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge your much larger opponent’s swipes
        and land some punches yourself. Then, Jot discovers the portal to the
        outside world.
        <br /><br />
        The twist is great; I certainly didn’t expect it and I imagine few did.
        I had thought that designing the 3D bedroom was a bit excessive for a
        trailer for a 2D adventure game, but I definitely didn’t make any
        assumptions. But aside from moving between 2D and 3D platforming, The
        Plucky Squire’s innovation doesn’t stop there.
        <br /><br />
        Jot battles on bookcases, but also makes his way across the sides of
        novelty mugs – again converted to his two dimensional self. The
        comparisons to A Link To The Past again rear their heads. Jot clearly
        inhabits two worlds, two dimensions if you will, and must shift between
        them on his quest for… Whatever his goal is. That in itself is a great
        premise, especially when each dimension is realised in such a beautiful
        style. But when you take into account the shifts in gameplay from
        top-down adventure, to 3D platformer, to side-scroller, to third-person
        fighter, this seems like a game that could have it all. Keep your eyes
        on The Plucky Squire, because it could be 2023’s indie hit.
