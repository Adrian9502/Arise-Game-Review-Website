      <p>
        The Call of Duty: Warzone beta takes a vastly different approach than
        most other battle royales. Death is an inconvenience rather than the
        end, top-tier weapons are consistently easy to come by, and skill will
        only get you so far when there are no more armor plates to loot. While
        that means it excels at being accessible and easy to pick up, it pays a
        high cost where depth is concerned. Solos manage to get all of the good
        without very much of the bad from these trade offs, but the same can’t
        be said when you squad up. Still, the impressive 150 player count, tried
        and tested arsenal from Modern Warfare, and well-crafted, massive map
        consistently deliver excellent firefights even if they sometimes lack
        the genre’s high stakes and endless variety.
      </p>
      <h2>World of Warzone</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Like Blackout before it, Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale map mashes up
        several familiar locations from Call of Duty’s past, albeit on a much
        larger scale. Verdansk is massive, dwarfing its predecessor and then
        some. And for a space this vast with a 150-player capacity, Warzone’s
        performance on PC impressed me as I rarely experienced frame drops or
        connectivity problems, which feels like a triumph in this context. I did
        have some trouble with mantling onto ledges in certain areas and the
        ping system just stops working if you try to use it at too long a range,
        not to mention that it isn’t nearly as intuitive or robust as the one
        found in Apex Legends. But these annoyances are very much the exception
        rather than the rule. You’ll be hard pressed to find an area devoid of
        well-crafted explorable structures brimming with weapons, supplies, and
        cash which can be redeemed at randomly placed buy stations for things
        like killstreaks, armor plates, or weaponry in loadout drops
        <br /><br />
        Like the name suggests, the loadout drop lets you equip the guns,
        gadgets, and perks of your custom Modern Warfare multiplayer loadouts in
        the middle of a Warzone match. And when I say middle, I really mean
        beginning. Acquiring the requisite $6,000 to purchase a drop can be done
        within the first minute of the round if all three players in a squad
        chip in. While you’ll still need to come by ammo and armor elsewhere,
        using a loadout drop to scratch two weapons, throwables, and perks off
        your shopping list in the first 60 seconds of a match is just too easy
        to make hunting for the randomly placed guns feel worth it.
        <br /><br />
        As a result, the stellar weapon variety that fuels other battle royales’
        replayability, creates exciting asymmetrical firefights, and
        incentivizes combat isn’t really a part of Warzone’s main squad-based
        battle royale mode. I never jumped with joy when scoring a rare gun from
        a chest or slain enemy since I knew my prefered kit was only moments
        away, if not already in hand. I also didn’t see the appeal of straying
        away from the Overkill perk or my favorite weapons from Modern Warfare’s
        multiplayer (like the M4 and HDR sniper rifle with a thermal optic),
        especially since trying something new would have effectively meant
        spending several hours unlocking attachments I didn’t already have – and
        I’m evidently not the only one who feels this way since the
        aforementioned combination (or some similar variation) are ubiquitous in
        Warzone.
      </p>
      <h2>Every weapon in the arsenal feels sublime.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Being an offshoot of Modern Warfare, every weapon in the arsenal feels
        sublime, so it's a shame that I wasn’t tempted to use more of them. I
        loved that Modern Warfare’s Gunfight mode exposed me to a wide variety
        of weapons thanks to its randomized loadouts and I had hoped Warzone
        would scratch that same itch. But even the high rarity weapons found in
        special orange chests around Verdansk and come pre-equipped with several
        attachments are a distant second to the guns I have literally dozens of
        hours of experience with. Loadout drops are a messy solution to a
        problem that didn’t exist in the first place, but they are less of an
        issue in solo battle royale where gathering the necessary cash is harder
        and the risk of calling in a conspicuous package at a hotly contested
        buy station is more perilous.
        <br /><br />
        The prospect of earning cash itself is at least a fun one thanks to
        contracts visible on the minimap that task your squad with scavenging
        supplies, capturing a zone-revealing recon station, or hunting a
        specific player. The bounty hunt contract reveals the enemy’s
        approximate location but doesn’t feel unfair since the prey are given
        ample warning and receive a cash bonus if the hunter fails to seal the
        deal in the allotted time. These novel mini-missions did a great job of
        breaking up duller moments and incentivizing movement.
        <br /><br />
        On the subject of looting, Warzone does away with the inventory
        entirely. Instead each player has a resource bar they can pull up to
        drop things like ammo, armor plates that effectively act as extra hit
        points, and cash for their teammates. Not having to manage an inventory
        in the middle of a firefight is nice, and automatically picking up any
        ammo you come across is even better. This system is a much better fit
        for the ease-of-use and fast pace synonymous with Call of Duty than
        Blackout’s somewhat clumsy inventory. The only place where it felt a
        little fidgety was looting specific equipment from dead players as their
        gear can sometimes explode around them in such a way that makes it hard
        to pick up any single item.
        <br /><br />
        Battle Casuale
        <br /><br />
        Warzone is teeming with new ideas, taking the default squad-based battle
        royale mode in a more casual direction than Black Ops 4’s Blackout. A
        large factor that contributes to this less than punishing change of pace
        is just how easy it is to respawn after dying in what is ultimately a
        last-man-standing mode. When you perish in battle your teammates can
        simply buy you back in at a buy station. This can occur as many times as
        their wallet allows, but it still feels fair since it gets harder to do
        as the round progresses, the respawning player is marked via a red
        flare, and, most importantly, it is a deliberate action that someone
        still in the game has to execute. None of the same can be said for the
        gulag.
        <br /><br />
        The gulag is where you go when you die for the first time – not to the
        menu to queue for a new match, but rather to the shower room of a prison
        to take part in a gladiatorial scrap with another dead player for a shot
        at reincarnation. The weapons are randomized and you only get one chance
        to redeploy via the gulag. If it sounds fun, that’s because it
        absolutely is. Even better, while you’re waiting for your turn to fight
        for your life, you can hurl stones at the current combatants or feed
        your incarcerated teammate realtime information about their gulag
        opponent’s location. That last part is pretty scummy, but hey… that’s
        prison.
      </p>
      <h2>
        While the gulag itself is a blast, I’m not a fan of the effect it has
        overall.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        While the gulag itself is a blast, I’m definitely not a fan of the
        effect it has on the battle royale taking place outside. You never
        really know when, where, or if a player has been respawned via the
        gulag, so getting killed or even just damaged by an enemy that drops on
        top of you feels terrible, even more so if you were the one that killed
        them in the first place. On one occasion I died during a teamfight, won
        my gulag match, and respawned directly over the same firefight just in
        time to spoil what should have been a clear victory for the opposing
        squad. While that may have been epic from my perspective, being on the
        receiving end of such a comeback feels utterly unfair because you’re
        never sure whether enemies are gone for good or just on their way back
        in. As a result, kills are neither particularly gratifying or assuring
        in the squad-based battle royale. The good news is that Warzone’s solo
        mode completely skirts around this problem by deploying victorious gulag
        players far away from the location of their death – I wish the default
        team-based mode followed suit with every respawning player, not just
        fully-wiped squads.
        <br /><br />
        My first win in Warzone came as a result of getting lucky as the gas
        ring closed directly onto a well-fortified hilltop that my squad and I
        were defending. It was a hollow victory though since I usually prefer to
        be aggressive in battle royales, but the more I played the more I
        realized Warzone’s mid-to-late game just doesn’t reward that behavior,
        which is disappointing. Unlike Blackout and Apex Legends, which
        guarantee that slain players drop at least some armor, Warzone has no
        problem leaving you on death’s door after successfully eliminating
        multiple squads. That’s because enemies only drop what they have on
        them, and armor plates and buy stations are naturally harder to come by
        as the round progresses. In a game like Call of Duty, it doesn’t feel
        good to walk away from a victorious firefight wishing you had avoided it
        all together.
        <br /><br />
        Stockpiling armor for the end of the match isn’t an option either since
        you can only hold five armor plates in reserve and it takes three to
        effectively heal back to full. That means that if a single encounter
        towards the end of the game doesn’t yield armor plates you’re in
        trouble. As a result, aggressive players or those forced to fight their
        way into the circle are punished while campers and opportunistic third
        parties are rewarded, which just isn’t any fun.
        <br /><br />
        Plunder
        <br /><br />
        Aside from the squad and solo battle royale modes, Verdansk also plays
        host to the Plunder mode, which sees about thirty teams of three players
        competing to collect the most cash in an allotted time. Unlike battle
        royale there is no circle, you spawn with your full multiplayer loadout,
        and upon dying you redeploy after a short delay. The goal is to earn
        cash by scavenging, competing contracts, and killing other squads and
        then bank it in a helicopter or cash-deposit balloon. I really like the
        idea of a more freeform objective-based mode on such a large scale, but
        in practice Plunder does absolutely nothing for me. The fast respawns
        mean that firefights with the same squad can drag on much longer than
        they should, and in one match where I was the top contributor on the
        winning team I hardly fought or came across anyone else. There are some
        cool concepts here, but in my experience they didn’t translate into fun
        gameplay.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        In spite of the serious concessions to depth made in the name of instant
        gratification, Call of Duty: Warzone’s beta remains thoroughly
        enjoyable. The battle royale formula is intact, albeit some of the
        aspects that usually make it so exciting and replayable are muted here.
        I’d love to see a reason to try something other than my Modern Warfare
        multiplayer loadout in the future given how easy it is to acquire, and
        think that the armor plate system and gulag are in need of revision. But
        my time spent in Verdask was still supremely fun even if the how and the
        why of it didn’t matter all that much.
