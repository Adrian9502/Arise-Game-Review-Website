      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        It was one of the first big free-to-play games, and one of the first big
        multiplayer online battle arenas, or MOBAs. But going on five years
        later, League of Legends still holds firm as an example of excellence.
        With its amazing variety of Champions, rewarding progression systems,
        and fast but intensely strategic team play, it easily hooked me and
        refused to let go. That addictiveness and competitive spirit, combined
        with a generous free-to-play approach and frequent updates from
        developer Riot Games, has created one of the biggest and liveliest
        gaming communities anywhere.
        <br /><br />
        Like most MOBAs, League of Legends’ main attraction is its five-on-five
        matches on its staple three-lane map. Called Summoner's Rift, this map
        is brightly and colorfully designed, and it creates a distinct playstyle
        with the way its dense brush allows you to conceal yourself and surprise
        enemies. I particularly love how the distinctive jungles on either side
        of the central river are filled with NPC monsters that give buffs to
        players who take a break from battle to go on the hunt – it’s a constant
        temptation to risk venturing into the other team’s territory to attempt
        to steal their buffs. The choice between engaging the other team
        directly or attacking their resources allows for interesting strategies
        and depth beyond simply fighting until one Champion or turret is dead.
        <br /><br />
        Inside each team's base also lies an Inhibitor which, if destroyed,
        causes the opposing team’s side to start spawning super minions. It’s an
        extra strategic objective to target in the enemy base, and having one
        more building to take down often leads to exciting and game-ending team
        fights.
        <br /><br />
        From Ziggs, the bomb-loving little rat, to Jinx, the blue-pigtailed
        maniac, it’s electrifying to coordinate with your team to mow down your
        opponents and push lanes with League’s characterful and cartoony
        Champions. They each have an innate passive ability that helps make them
        more dynamic without increasing the already-complex management of active
        abilities. Teemo’s passive Camouflage power, for example, is a great way
        to sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. Plus, the quirky things they say
        and their flashy active abilities make the Champions memorable. I can’t
        help but laugh every time the adorable Lulu says, "Yep! That tasted
        purple!"
        <br /><br />
        As free-to-play games go, League of Legends is a model of generosity.
        Though it doesn’t give everything away like Dota 2 does, it serves up a
        weekly rotating selection of 10 Champions for free, and you can purchase
        and play with any of the 117-character roster for a reasonable price of
        between two and eight dollars each. Yes, that adds up to a princely sum
        if you intend to buy every single character, but there’s no need to buy
        more than you intend to actually play. The Champion rotation is a nice
        way to try before you buy, and helped me to pace myself by learning just
        a few characters at a time.
        <br /><br />
        You can also unlock every Champion at a satisfying rate without spending
        a penny, which is not only fulfilling, but it sets League apart from the
        type of free-to-play game that deliberately makes it impractical to play
        at a competitive level for no cost. Since many players opt for a
        completely free experience, it’s exciting when the roster changes and
        pushes the community to try out fresh characters and new strategies.
        <br /><br />
        If you want to go a step further, you can buy cosmetic skins for every
        character. They can be pricey, but each skin has tons of detail, and
        it’s impressive that most of them come with unique spell effects and
        animations. My Panda Annie skin, for example, changes the little
        pink-haired girl into a mini-geisha of sorts, and her ultimate ability
        calls down a panda version of her grizzly bear, Tibbers. (Yay, Tibbers!)
        <br /><br />
        In the opening minutes of a match, League's Champions distinguish
        themselves with lots of low-level area-of-effect abilities that make
        killing minions quick and easy. Unlike some other MOBAs, there's no way
        to attack your own minions to deprive your enemy the experience and
        gold, making it simpler to focus on other tasks, like getting last hits.
        The absence of those “denial” tactics definitely takes a competitive
        aspect away from League, but it's one that's often frustrating. I don’t
        miss it.
        <br /><br />
        Relative to other MOBAs where management of special-ability juice (magic
        points, in this case) is key, I also enjoy how often abilities are
        available for use in League. It’s awesome being able to constantly
        harass opponents with spells rather than having to worry about
        conserving them all for one crucial moment. But that doesn’t mean
        abilities don’t matter. Some of the strongest attacks are skill shots
        (projectiles requiring precise manual aim), and failing to hit your
        target can have catastrophic, game-changing consequences in team fights.
        From simple slows to huge Super Mega Death Rockets that travel across
        the whole map, snagging enemies with these moves while dodging theirs is
        a giddy thrill. The importance League of Legends places on these skill
        shots helps set its style of action apart.
        <br /><br />
        You don’t lose any money when you die in League, making it easier to
        save up for new weapons and armor in the item shop. The item selection
        is decent, but most players always seem to rely on you to build your
        character using expected items, like The Bloodthirster or Rabadon's
        Deathcap. Straying from the recommended builds doesn't make you useless,
        but some of these might as well be called required items instead of
        recommended, considering their power. On the bright side, this means
        spending less time shopping and more time playing. Also, the recent
        addition of a variety of Support items, like The Frost Queen’s Claim and
        Talisman of Ascension which grant passive gold, are a good move in the
        right direction for diversifying builds.
        <br /><br />
        It might be easier to coordinate unusual item builds if League had
        built-in voice chat. Unless you’ve set up a
        TeamSpeak/Ventrilo/Mumble/Skype/etc call with your pre-arranged team
        before joining a game, the only ways to communicate are via text, which
        often goes unnoticed, or through four alerts to indicate danger, on my
        way, missing, or assist me. Nothing sucks more than watching a crucial
        surprise attack slip through my fingers because a teammate was too busy
        to see me pinging. At least when your team falls so hopelessly behind 20
        minutes into a 40-ish minute match that four of five teammates agree
        it’s all over, the handy surrender option prevents you from wasting time
        fighting a losing battle.
        <br /><br />
        Win or lose, earning both experience and Influence Points (IP) to unlock
        and customize Champions is rewarding. Building up my persistent profile
        (called a Summoner profile) outside a match was good motivation to keep
        playing, as along the way to the max level of 30 you'll unlock crucial
        Summoner spells to use in game. Flash, for example, teleports you a
        short distance, sometimes giving you just enough range to strike or
        dodge a killing blow. Deciding which two to take into each match adds an
        interesting extra strategic layer, and their long cooldown timers make
        it tough to be sure when someone will have extra tricks up their sleeve.
        <br /><br />
        Each level-up also unlocks Masteries, which are free points to spend on
        specific bonuses from offensive, defensive, and utility trees. But
        considering there are obvious choices for how you should spend them when
        you’re playing each role, this system feels redundant. Likewise, you can
        also use IP to purchase Runes that enhance a Champion’s stats, but this
        never amounts to much. The illusion of progression is nice, but games
        still almost always come down to player skill rather than a few extra
        stats.
        <br /><br />
        Where League of Legends really shines is on the competitive level. Once
        you reach level 30 (which took me about 160 wins), as long as you have
        16 Champs earned or bought and have played some placement matches, you
        can compete in Ranked play with the most serious players. The fantastic
        ladder system ensures you’ll play against people on the same skill level
        (until periodic resets, and the process begins anew). Making your way up
        the ranks is a serious achievement, and knowing that ladder points are
        on the line makes the competition in every match even more fierce.
        <br /><br />
        At the other end of the spectrum, League’s excellent tutorial is gentle
        way to ease into MOBA mechanics, and its AI bot players give a
        judgement-free way of learning to play new characters. One major feature
        that’s missing, though, is a means of watching match replays to better
        learn from mistakes. Considering they're a great training tool in other
        MOBAs and competitive games of all genres, it's a shame they aren't
        included.
        <br /><br />
        When you need a break from Summoner’s Rift, there are other,
        faster-paced modes to choose from. Dominion and All Random All Mid
        (ARAM) are both quick, usually lasting about 25 minutes rather than 45
        to 60. Using the Champions to sprint around a small map to capture
        points in Dominion is silly yet competitive, and ARAM forces everyone to
        use a random Champion on a one-lane map and is more about catching the
        other team off guard and pushing your advantage. I had a great time
        purchasing strange item combinations from the increased amount of gold
        you get in these modes, and the consistent action-packed brawls are a
        breath of fresh air relative to the slow and steady gold farming and
        item building of Summoner's Rift.
        <br /><br />
        While the gameplay is intensely fun and the Champions are fantastic, the
        main thing holding League of Legends back is its Adobe Air client. With
        such an incredible visual finesse throughout the entire stylized MOBA,
        it's unfortunate how dated the slow, buggy client is. The incredibly
        long load times are nice when you need a drink, but ultimately waiting
        two minutes before each game gets annoying. You can’t even change your
        in-game settings before you hop into a match. Updating the client and
        servers will take some incredible technical prowess, but they’re
        undoubtedly the weakest links of an otherwise very strong chain.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Even though you play on the same few maps with similar items, there’s so
        much depth and strategy going on that no two matches of League of
        Legends ever feel the same. It’s distinctive style encourages surprise
        attacks and frequent use of skill-shot powers, and its colorful art
        style makes everything pop on the screen. Learning how to make the most
        of its characters and to become an asset to a team is a long and
        challenging process, but once you’ve got it down, it’s incredibly
        satisfying to work together to destroy your enemies in this amazing
        MOBA.
