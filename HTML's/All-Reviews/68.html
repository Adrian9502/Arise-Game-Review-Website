      <p>
        Signing up for an MMO encompasses more than your standard purchase.
        You're buying into a social network to meet other players and maybe make
        a few new friends. To some it's an escape, an alternative lifestyle, a
        toy, an ego machine, and to all it's a game. Simply providing a vast
        online fantasy world to run around in with others isn't enough these
        days. While Final Fantasy XIV features a flexible class system and
        interesting crafting mechanics, issues with its presentation,
        performance, and core questing structure turn what could be an
        entertaining online adventure into an arduous experience that, in its
        current state, isn't worth playing.
        <br /><br />
        If you're familiar with Final Fantasy XI, Square Enix's previous MMO in
        its flagship RPG line, you'll know the game was never very easy to get
        into. While Final Fantasy XIV is certainly more solo-friendly for
        players who prefer to quest and level on their own, it's disappointingly
        unfriendly toward those trying figure out all the various rules and
        systems churning beneath the surface that govern life, advancement, and
        success in its setting of Eorzea. If you've never played an MMO before,
        this is most definitely not the place to start. Even genre veterans are
        going to need to spend a good deal of time scanning fan sites and
        databases to understand how everything works, even for basic information
        on necessary functions like performing item repairs.
        <br /><br />
        Things do start out in a directed fashion, though. At the beginning
        you're given a chance to create and name your character. A number of
        races, from the hulking Roegadyn to the cat-like Miqo'te, can be chosen
        and customized in a few different ways. As tends to be standard in the
        genre you'll also be asked to pick a class, though the choice isn't
        especially meaningful. In Final Fantasy XIV you're never locked into one
        particular class, so the one chosen at the start only defines your
        character for as long as it takes to get to an item shop.
        <br /><br />
        Before stepping onto the game's various progression treadmills you'll be
        dumped into a sequence of cut-scenes filled with character dialogue,
        combat, and exploration around whichever city you chose to start in.
        These story-driven scenes are some of the best parts of the game as it
        stands right now, helping to tell the tale of the world, showing you
        around the land, and foreshadowing events to come. More story missions
        become available at later progression milestones and eventually unlock
        other extras, but are so spaced out that feel more like bandages to
        remedy a general lack of narrative context throughout. It's rare to ever
        feel as though you're questing for a reason outside of bumping up your
        class rank.
        <br /><br />
        For braving the dangers that lie outside of the walls of each major
        starting city in Eorzea you'll have a number of combat options. Magic
        users will want to take up arms as a Conjurer or Thaumaturge, while
        those who prefer to hit enemies with heavy things will want to pick the
        axe-wielding Marauder or the Gladiator who attacks and defends with a
        sword and shield. The variety of combat classes means players should be
        able to find a mold in which they feel comfortable, but the nice part is
        you'll never feel too limited.
        <br /><br />
        By simply purchasing and equipping a class' weapon type, you become that
        class. If you're tired of slogging through fight after fight as a
        Lancer, for instance, you can just equip a bow and all of a sudden
        you're an Archer. The trick to effective play is unlocking skills in
        various classes to customize your ideal build. For example, you could
        level up a Pugilist and a Conjurer to unlock heal abilities, then switch
        to a Marauder and equip the helpful skills to make you more durable in
        solo combat. That Square Enix grants this kind of freedom to players is
        great to see, and it's fun to experiment with all the different styles
        of play to see what you like best, or simply having the option to
        quickly swap classes should the needs of a group require a new tank,
        healer, or ranged damage dealer.
        <br /><br />
        The crafting and gathering systems built into the game also contribute
        to the class system. If you equip a mining pick, you can then hack at
        deposits for ore and other valuables. Then if you equip other specialty
        equipment you'll don the hat of a wide range of production classes, from
        those that build heavy armor to those that tinker with rings and
        jewelry. These crafting and gathering systems aren't merely side
        activities, but heavily integrated into the rhythms of life in Eorzea.
        Success in crafting and harvesting quests yields points that not only
        rank up the class, but also contribute to a universal pool of experience
        called physical level. So while each class is leveled on an individual
        basis only while the corresponding tool or weapon is equipped, you'll
        always be earning experience for the physical level. When increased, it
        frees up points to be assigned to things like attack, defense and
        accuracy, as well as a variety of magical properties, which gives a
        solid sense of a growing overall power even while you're not swinging
        weapons out on the battlefield.
        <br /><br />
        Aside from that, crafting is especially important in the game since it's
        the primary method of getting better gear. The occasional item can be
        earned by completing quests, but in general if you want better gear
        you're going to have to build it, buy it directly from a crafter, or
        find it on the open market. Like many of the game's functions, little is
        explained about the actual crafting process. Once learned you'll find
        it's a high risk system that infuses a significant degree of chance into
        the creation process as you juggle a variety of percentage sliders and
        an abstract color-coding system. Failure is a frequent part of this
        process, but that makes successful production all the more satisfying.
        <br /><br />
        Because of the way the class system is set up you could, theoretically,
        be a master of all crafts, though realistically I would assume people
        only have time to focus on one or two things. There's plenty of social
        interaction built into the creation system, as some classes can only
        build components that others fashion into a whole, and getting different
        items repaired requires assistance by specific crafters. The problem
        since launch has been one of dissemination. It's always possible to spam
        chat channels with requests for armor or advertisements for personal
        stock to trade with others, but the heart of Final Fantasy XIV's economy
        is the market system, which right now is a mess.
        <br /><br />
        Square Enix has said that updates are on the way for improving the
        markets, but even with some aid it's only one of many examples of a
        system that wasn't adequately developed prior to launch. As of this
        review's publish time the system requires you to hire a retainer, an NPC
        that can be given items and set in an instanced market area. The idea is
        that other players will enter into this area, find your retainer, and
        then purchase items you put up for sale. Yet in practice it means
        there's a disorganized mess of NPC retainers standing around market
        areas with little indication of what's being sold. If you want to buy a
        new sword, you have to visit one by one every retainer in sight until
        you just happen to by chance come across one in stock. It's a grossly
        inefficient process, and perplexing that it ever made it into the launch
        version of the game. For a game with such a heavy emphasis on crafted
        items, it's unfortunate Square Enix felt it was acceptable to implement
        such a fragmented distribution framework.
        <br /><br />
        Once you're through with crafting, selling and buying, it's out into the
        field to you to go participate in the game's quests. These are referred
        to as levequests of which only a limited quantity are available at a
        time. In the downtime until more quests unlock, the idea is to get you
        to interact with others to latch onto their quests, again serving as a
        method of strengthening the social fabric of the game. Initiating a
        quest requires you travel out to camps scattered around the landscapes
        outside of cities. In each sits a giant crystal called an Aetheryte
        where quests are initiated, and you're then put on a timer until the
        objectives are achieved and the task completed. Initially it'll be a fun
        adventure as you burn through tasks and quickly rank up, but with
        continued play the levequests lose their appeal.
        <br /><br />
        When it comes to MMOs, what really separates the best from the rest are
        the ways they keep the entertainment value high over long tracts of
        time. In the case of levequesting, you're given kill and collection
        quotas with an extremely thin veneer of story. It won't be long until
        each quest starts to feel exactly the same. The ways Square Enix
        attempts to infuse variety – targets fleeing for reinforcements, targets
        changing form – fall flat. For the first few levels it isn't
        particularly noticeable since the process of ranking up your class
        happens fairly quickly. However, once you reach higher levels and
        realize there are only a handful of quests you'll need to churn through
        for hours and hours before becoming powerful enough to reach the next
        camp and quest set, it's difficult to stay motivated. The game does far
        too little to mask the fact that it's tossed you on a gerbil wheel.
        <br /><br />
        If you can deal with jumping through the same hoops time and time again,
        there's at least a difficulty system associated with quests. With a
        larger group it's best to set the quest for a higher degree of challenge
        with the notion of potentially earning more skill points for your class.
        A few other activities exist as well, though their overall effect isn't
        significant. There's an hourly behest quest that can be taken on, which
        is essentially a larger-scale version of the levequests. Dungeons lie
        all over the land, faction quests open up once enough favor is gained,
        and of course there's always the option to grind solo or in groups,
        which is as mind-meltingly dull as it's ever been.
        <br /><br />
        Thankfully the actual combat is fun to play around with. Since you'll be
        collecting skills from each class as well as focusing on whichever you
        prefer, group members can have a diverse range of abilities regardless
        of class designation. The game also limits the amount of abilities that
        can be active at one time, meaning you can't just equip everything at
        once, but must determine which skills work best together. During the
        slow-paced combat you'll find all the familiar roles – tanks, healers,
        ranged damage dealers, and those better suited for defeating single and
        multiple targets. How this system develops over the course of Final
        Fantasy XIV's life cycle will be interesting to watch, especially
        aspects like the battle regimen mechanic whereby group members can queue
        up attacks and then unload on enemies to trigger special effects.
        Unfortunately a variety of elements, from targeting to input precision,
        are affected by the game's poorly designed interface and performance
        issues.
        <br /><br />
        Considering how frequently you need to interact with the interface in
        combat and while buying and selling, it's surprising Square Enix decided
        to build in something so inelegant. For some reason it's required that
        you open a main menu tab to access any of the critical menus like
        ability customization menus, gear layout, and quest journals, and there
        are way too many submenus that must be opened in order to get the
        simplest of tasks accomplished. In individual cases these don't seem
        like much but over the span of weeks and months of play it adds up to a
        dizzying amount of time wasted on navigating the cumbersome menus.
        <br /><br />
        Other mystifying inconveniences include burying your gear's durability
        status, a near useless overworld map, and making selling items to
        vendors or exchanging with your retainer an unnecessarily painful
        process, making you wonder what the developers were thinking when coming
        up with this. It could be that it'll be the same interface that's
        eventually put into the PlayStation 3 version, but for PC players it's a
        perpetual hindrance. Hopefully in the time post-launch Square Enix will
        take steps to work on this and make character management less of a chore
        to handle.
        <br /><br />
        Yet the issues don't end there. A big focus over the coming months will
        hopefully be with regards to performance optimization. Even on a near
        top of the line machine the game chugs consistently. If you've got a
        less powerful machine and turn down the settings, it's unfortunately
        still a stuttery experience. It's not unplayable, but in outdoor
        locations especially around Limsa Lominsa, it's something that can't be
        ignored and that frequently intrudes on the combat and joy of
        exploration.
        <br /><br />
        The saddest part is that the game, performance problems aside, is one of
        the prettiest MMOs I've ever seen. The sandy mesa and rock formations
        around the dusty stretches of Ul'dah are incredibly detailed, especially
        as you expand the reach of your travels and discover vast valleys and
        stunning landscape variation. The tall trees clouding the skies around
        Gridania aren't quite as impressive when compared against the vast
        grassy terrain and outcroppings of white rock around Limsa Lominsa, but
        it's all consistently impressive, especially when you're able to observe
        the lighting during a sunset along the rim of the world over the
        silhouette of a sprawling fantastical city.
        <br /><br />
        Armor and weapons designs are equally well detailed, making them all the
        more alluring beyond the obvious statistical benefits. Animations are
        smooth and realistic, with characters and enemy types moving about with
        a sense of weight that helps infuse Eorzea with a degree of realism as
        you hack away at dodos, marmots, wolves, and more fearsome creatures at
        higher levels. The soundtracks is also a standout feature, with music
        that sounds distinctly at home in a Final Fantasy game playing and
        shifting throughout, and the occasional smattering of voice acting
        during story missions.
        <br /><br />
        It's important to note that as of right now this is a game built for
        player versus environment content, so steer clear if you're into
        competitive player versus player combat. If you're someone who likes to
        sprint to the highest levels as fast as possible, Square Enix has built
        in limits. Resources that can be drawn on to fast traveling between
        camps and cities and special bonuses during quests can be depleted and
        regenerate slowly, meaning it's best to only play for a few hours per
        session which, quite honestly, is reasonable.
        <br /><br />
        What's odd is that these mechanisms seems to be built to cater to a more
        casual crowd, though the game is clearly built for a hardcore player
        with plenty of time to spend. Keep in mind getting anything done of
        significance in Final Fantasy XIV even at low levels can take an
        extremely long amount of time, in part because the game is designed to
        be played at a relaxed pace, but also because you're forced to waste so
        much time fidgeting with the interface and dealing with lag and
        performance annoyances. And if after reading all this you're still
        interested in the game, head over to our review journal for more detail
        on how everything works.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        With its newest MMO in its flagship franchise, Square Enix delivers a
        gigantic, beautiful fantasy world to explore. The flexible class system
        means you'll be able to mix and match abilities from many different
        roles so you can change your specialization at will. Much of the promise
        of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned,
        unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that
        hinder the experience at nearly every step. While there's a lot to
        consider when building your ideal class, there's far too little
        interesting structured content to chew on, resulting in an experience
        that quickly grows tedious and tiresome. All MMOs are designed to keep
        players logging in for long into the future, but at launch Final Fantasy
        XIV's questing mechanics feel more like a subway commute than a fun
        gameplay experience. Patches over the course of the next few months may
        address many of the technical issues, but for now this is not a world
        worth visiting.
