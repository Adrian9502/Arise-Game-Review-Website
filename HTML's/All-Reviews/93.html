      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        The first Devil May Cry sparked my love of action games in general, but
        as the series has gone on it’s kept that place in my heart because they
        aren’t just about killing every enemy in a room. They’re about how you
        killed every enemy in a room, expressing yourself in an almost artistic
        and highly technical dance of swords, guns, and lots of jump cancels.
        Devil May Cry 5 is the new pinnacle of this particular subset of the
        genre, thanks to a perfectly paced campaign that mixes in three
        completely different playstyles, each of which containing enough depth
        to carry a game of their own; a fun and satisfying story; and quite
        simply one of the best combat systems you’ll find in video games.
        <br /><br />
        Devil May Cry 5’s story is somewhat unconventional in that it starts
        with events that would normally feel like the climax: you’re thrown
        right into a fight you’re meant to lose. After Dante stays behind to let
        Nero and a new character named V escape from a super-powered demon king
        named Urizen, the story jumps around a time period of a couple of
        months, rotating through perspectives as it tells the present-day story
        of Dante, Nero, and V, while also explaining the circumstances that led
        to Urizen’s rise to power and V’s quest to take him down.
        <br /><br />
        There’s a great air of mystery to the unknown nature of both Urizen and
        V. Like Nero, I was never sure if I could trust V and found myself
        formulating theory after theory about his identity and motives with
        every new morsel of information that was fed to me. By the end of its 10
        to 12 hours I still had some questions left over, but overall the plot
        kept me hooked all the way through with satisfying revelations, a few
        answers that fill in some long-standing series plot holes, and of
        course, the off-the-wall action that only Devil May Cry can deliver.
        <br /><br />
        Devil May Cry 5’s combat is absolutely sublime.
        <br /><br />
        On the surface, it’s a very simple system: There’s one button for melee
        attacks, one for ranged attacks, and one for your Devil Breaker, style
        technique, or cane attack, depending on which character you’re using. If
        that’s as deep as you want to go, you can absolutely get through the
        campaign on normal difficulty just fine with nothing more. There’s even
        an “auto-assist” mode that automatically performs cool and flashy combos
        by just mashing the attack button, letting even casual players feel what
        it’s like to play at a higher technical level.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The beauty of DMC 5’s combat is in the depth, creative freedom, and
        variety.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        But the beauty of Devil May Cry 5’s combat is in the depth, creative
        freedom, and variety its three sets of tools offer. If you’re playing as
        Nero, those tools are your revvable Red Queen sword, chargeable Blue
        Rose handgun, a grapple that can pull enemies towards you, and an
        ever-growing arsenal of Devil Breakers, which are disposable mechanical
        arms that each provide Nero with new abilities and utility. My favorite,
        Punchline, shoots out an arm that homes in on an enemy and keeps them in
        place with quick rocket punches. But the real fun starts when you hold
        down the Devil Breaker button while Punchline is out, allowing you to
        jump on top of it and ride it like a hoverboard, knocking enemies up
        into the air with flips, 360s, and other sick stunts.
        <br /><br />
        Dante’s gameplay is by far the most familiar because he plays almost
        exactly the same as his Devil May Cry 4 counterpart, which is to say
        that he’s essentially a Swiss army knife. He can swap between four
        distinct styles (Trickster, Royal Guard, Gunslinger, and Swordmaster)
        four melee weapons, and four ranged weapons, all on the fly. His arsenal
        is a fantastic mix of old and new, with the old weapons kept fresh
        thanks to a number of new tweaks and techniques, and the new weapons
        adding new layers to Dante’s combat that he’s never had before. He even
        has a motorcycle that he can crash into enemies with and then transform
        into two slow but heavy-hitting buzzsaw swords and back again, all in
        the space of a single combo.
      </p>
      <h2>
        V plays completely unlike any character in any Devil May Cry game.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And then finally there’s V, who plays completely unlike any character in
        any Devil May Cry game due to the fact that he barely does any of the
        fighting himself. Instead, he summons three familiars to do battle for
        him: There’s Shadow, a black cat that can morph into various blades and
        creatures; Griffon, a bird that can fire a variety of electrical blasts
        from a distance; and Nightmare, a gargantuan beast that can only be
        summoned when V builds up his Devil Trigger meter. Nightmare fights
        completely autonomously, and it can be very extremely satisfying to
        watch him emerge through a wall or rain down from the sky and just wreck
        a whole crowd of enemies.
        <br /><br />
        Your familiars can’t actually kill anything, though, so V has to
        teleport around and deliver the finishing blow with his cane once an
        enemy has been primed for the kill. That leads to some very cool kill
        sequences where V just blinks from enemy to enemy, wiping them out one
        by one while your familiars carry on the fight in the background.
        <br /><br />
        Using V effectively has a pretty steep learning curve, even by Devil May
        Cry standards, due to the fact that you don’t actually have any
        directional control over Shadow or Griffon. Getting them to attack a
        specific enemy can be a challenge, and trying to keep track of where
        they are in relation to the enemy can also be tricky. However, you can
        use some of your Devil Trigger meter to have them autonomously attack,
        allowing you to focus on dodging. Or, if you feel you have a few moments
        of safety you could read a book and regain some of that meter... Or just
        play some violin to taunt them.
        <br /><br />
        Even so, V’s missions are the weakest of the trio, mainly because his
        movement feels so much more limited compared to Dante and Nero. But
        that’s not to say that they’re bad by any stretch. Once you get a couple
        of upgrades for Shadow and Griffon under your belt and get used to the
        flow of combat, V’s unique gameplay becomes quite fun, and it’s used
        sparingly enough to never outstay its welcome.
        <br /><br />
        It should also be duly noted that you can purchase Red Orbs, Devil May
        Cry 5’s main source of currency, with real money. That’s always a bad
        look. That being said, the Red Orb cost of just about every upgrade and
        technique feels appropriately priced (aside from one special technique
        for each character that’s clearly there for high-level players to strive
        for), and I never felt any kind of need or desire to drop real cash on
        Red Orbs, nor did I ever feel like I had to farm them in-game.
        <br /><br />
        It should be said that Devil May Cry 5 looks and sounds stellar. Style
        and personality oozes out every animation, whether it’s Nero’s wild
        engine-powered sword attacks that send him flying across the level,
        Dante’s smug teasing of the various bosses, or V’s subtle mannerisms
        that just add to his mystique.
        <br /><br />
        Level design is more linear and much less puzzle-heavy relative to
        previous Devil May Cry games, which I appreciated, as it kept the brisk
        pace up and put more of an emphasis on skill-based combat challenges.
        Like, for example, there are a few where you must kill a pack of enemies
        before their weight causes the platform to fall, which would seal off a
        hidden room with goodies. That being said, the environments are not as
        varied as they have been in the past, and you’ll be traveling through a
        lot of similarly demon-torn cityscapes and hellish underground chasms.
        <br /><br />
        Though the Devil May Cry games have a bit of a reputation for being
        difficult, on its default settings DMC5 isn’t terribly hard. In fact,
        it’s actually quite forgiving if all you want to do is survive the
        ordeal. When you die, you can use a Gold Orb to revive on the spot with
        all your health and Devil Trigger meters refilled, and those aren’t hard
        to come by: You can often find them off the beaten path in a level, you
        earn one per day as a daily login bonus, or you can have your
        performance rated positively in the weird cameo system, which records a
        ghost of your character when you play through certain levels and adds
        that ghost into another player’s game. If you run out of Gold Orbs (I
        was swimming in them by the end) you can also spend the much more common
        Red Orbs to revive with and buy back health.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It’s not about just killing all the enemies in the room, but how you
        kill the enemies in the room.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Staying alive isn’t really the challenge, though. As I said at the
        start, what I love about Devil May Cry as a series is that it’s not
        about just killing all the enemies in the room, but how you kill the
        enemies in the room. Trying to get SSS ranks is a real worthwhile
        challenge that made up for the lack of base difficulty. To that end, I
        sprang at every opportunity to buy new techniques, which is rewarding
        because Devil May Cry 5 is paced in such a way that you are constantly
        getting new toys at just about every turn – whether it be a new form,
        weapon, or Devil Breaker – and they all come with their own set of new
        upgrades. By the end of the story all three of my characters felt like
        all-powerful gods, with even more upgrades still left to be purchased
        for my next run in the unlockable Son of Sparda mode, which is
        essentially New Game+ and where the true challenge of Devil May Cry 5
        starts to rear its head.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, a great combat system isn’t worth much if the enemies aren’t
        fun to fight, but fortunately Devil May Cry 5’s meet the high standards
        set by previous games in the series. There’s a great mix of common
        fodder enemies that allow you to do basically whatever you want to them
        to build your combos, tanky enemies that require specific tactics to
        bypass their defenses, and powerful support baddies that can deal big
        damage from afar and can be very threatening if not brought down
        quickly. The same goes for bosses, with a few of the later fights being
        among the strongest the series has seen. There’s a solid variety of them
        too, with several towering and powerful beasts, others who are agile and
        elusive, but the best are just straight up one-on-one duels with
        high-speed action that require quick reflexes and a careful balance of
        offense and defense.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        The question of which Devil May Cry game is the best has gotten much
        easier with Devil May Cry 5. The combat is the strongest the series has
        seen to date, the story does a great job of balancing all three of its
        main characters and doling out rewarding bits of its mysterious story at
        an enticing pace, and the unlockable difficulties, sheer number of
        techniques to earn, and the upcoming free Bloody Palace DLC will provide
        a ton of incentive for replayability. It’s good to have you back, Dante
        and Nero.
