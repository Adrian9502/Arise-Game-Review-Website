      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        Growing up as a child of 90s and early 2000s arcades, I’ve been a casual
        enjoyer of the Tekken series pretty much all throughout its lifespan,
        with its cabinets being a regular spot where I would dump a few
        quarters, mash some buttons, and walk away with a smile on my face. I’ve
        put some time into just about all of them, but I’ve never really
        attempted to learn the deeper complexities of its mechanics or really
        sat down to try and become good with a character. That’s going to change
        with Tekken 8, because after spending about four hours with it, I’m all
        in.
        <br /><br />
        While I am a self-admitted casual fan of the Tekken series, I have at
        least dabbled enough into Tekken 7 to be able to talk about the most
        defining differences between it and Tekken 8. Chief among those changes
        is the new Heat System, which is all about enforcing one of Tekken 8’s
        biggest design goals: Rewarding aggression.
      </p>
      <h2>After spending about four hours with Tekken 8, I'm all in.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        With the press of a button, a character can use a Heat Burst to enter
        Heat Mode. The effects of it differ from character-to-character, but in
        general you can view it as a limited time state where you’re basically
        better at everything. Certain moves have new properties; others recover
        faster, making them more advantageous on block; and you gain access to
        new moves that aren’t available outside of Heat Mode.
        <br /><br />
        One of the key elements of Heat Mode is that while it is time-limited,
        with a meter that slowly depletes once activated, you can actually stop
        that meter from going down by landing attacks. This is just one of the
        ways that Tekken 8 looks to encourage its players to be more aggressive,
        because if you’re able to push the pace and land hits while in Heat
        Mode, you can keep the state going throughout most, if not all of the
        round.
        <br /><br />
        And if you decide that you instead want to cash out on damage rather
        than remain in Heat Mode, you can use a Heat Smash, which is like a
        mini-Rage Art super move that does a large amount of damage, but spends
        the rest of your Heat Meter.
        <br /><br />
        The Heat System goes deeper than that too. In addition to there being a
        heat meter, there are also these little icons that govern your usage of
        certain actions while in Heat Mode. This is called Heat Energy, and if
        you enter Heat Mode with a Heat Burst, you’ll only get one stock of it.
        However, if you use what’s known as a “Heat Engager,” you’ll enter Heat
        Mode with two stocks. These are special moves that when landed, will
        instantly put your character into the Heat State. Every character has
        five of them, and they’re usually some of the most defining moves of
        each character. After you land a Heat Engager, you can spend a stock of
        Heat Energy to use a Heat Dash, which lets you quickly dash in to either
        connect combos that otherwise could not normally be connected, or if the
        Heat Engager is blocked, you can just get right back up in their face to
        continue your offense.
      </p>
      <h2>
        My favorite element of the Heat System is how it's used to further
        define the unique aspects of every character.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        My favorite element of the Heat System, though, is how it's used to
        further define the unique aspects of every character. Every character
        has at least one completely unique advantage in Heat Mode. For example,
        when in Heat Mode, King gets armor on his Jaguar Run, making him a
        grappler with an armored command run to get in on opponents. Kazuya
        meanwhile, can execute his iconic Electric Wind God Fist technique
        without having to be frame perfect on the input.
        <br /><br />
        What I also love about the Heat system is that it’s available right at
        the start of every round. It’s not a comeback mechanic and you don’t
        need to build up a meter in order to gain access to it – you’re free to
        use it whenever and however you please. The already existing comeback
        mechanic from Tekken 7, Rage, does make a return, with it once again
        causing a character to go into a Rage State once they reach a critical
        level of health. While in the Rage State, your damage increases, and you
        gain access to your ultra powerful rage art technique. That said, Rage
        Drives are a thing of the past, largely because it's a mechanic that
        felt redundant due to the addition of the Heat State and the advantages
        it provides.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The most interesting part of the Special control scheme is that you can
        switch between it and the classic style mid-match.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Another brand new element of Tekken 8 is the addition of a “Special”
        control type, which is Tekken 8’s new attempt at making its complex
        fighting system a little more approachable for newcomers. When in
        Special control mode, each button has a recommended move and combo for
        each character. There’s a button for juggle combos, a button for
        grounded combos, and a button for quick low attacks. The selected moves
        even change depending on what state you’re in. While this allows new
        players to compete with more intermediate players in terms of the damage
        they’re able to output, the key thing to keep in mind is that players
        using the special control scheme only have access to a very small
        selection of moves.
        <br /><br />
        The most interesting part of the Special control scheme though, and the
        thing that really sets it apart from Street Fighter 6’s new Modern
        Control scheme, is that you can switch between the classic and special
        control styles mid-match with the press of a button. This makes it
        actually a fairly viable option for more experienced players as well, as
        you could be playing the match out in the classic control scheme,
        suddenly have an opportunity for a big punish, quickly swap to the
        Special control style, and start mashing out a combo. It also seems like
        a great learning tool to be able to quickly jump in with a new character
        and get a feel for what their moves and combos are going to look like
        without having to memorize a whole bunch of techniques just to be
        competitive.
        <br /><br />
        Those are all pretty substantial changes, so it's comforting to know
        that everything still feels like some “Good-Ass Tekken”. In my playtime,
        I mostly experimented with King, who’s just as much of a powerhouse as
        he’s always been. One of my favorite changes to him is that his Reverse
        Arm Slam combo has been simplified, allowing him to go into the next
        throw in the chain with a single button press as opposed to a series of
        inputs that need to be memorized. He does still have the latter, and
        those are probably more damaging and harder to break, but as someone
        who’s always loved King, but was always intimidated by all the commands
        needed to do a full chain grab combo, I appreciated having at least one
        that I could easily commit to memory and rely on pretty much right from
        the get-go of learning the character.
        <br /><br />
        I want to give a shoutout to Tekken 8’s command list too, which does a
        great job of giving some extra context to the recommended moves for
        every character. It told me recommended combos, moves to use that are
        advantageous on block, what moves will launch an opponent, what to do
        after launching them, what to do after activating heat mode, and much
        more. These movelists are extremely intimidating, with them each
        containing hundreds of techniques, and Bandai Namco is really putting in
        the effort by making them much more user friendly.
        <br /><br />
        After my playtime was over, I left with a renewed enthusiasm to get into
        Tekken on a more serious level. Tekken 8 looks phenomenal, its hits feel
        as impactful as ever, and its iconic cast of characters are even more
        uniquely defined thanks to the new Heat system. There’s still a lot we
        have yet to see, but as far first impressions go, Tekken 8 is a
        knockout.
