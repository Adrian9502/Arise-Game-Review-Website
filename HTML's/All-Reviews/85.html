      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        For a series known for virtually non-stop shooting, it’s surprising how
        much time you spend in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s single-player
        campaign with your weapons holstered. Certainly more than any other game
        in the franchise’s 17-year history. But whether it’s walking around your
        safehouse and getting to know your covert ops crew or sneaking around
        KGB headquarters as a Russian double agent trying to figure out a way to
        smuggle your American friends into the ultra-secure building, the latest
        COD puts that quiet time to good use. Sure, it’s got plenty of loud
        parts too – there are high-speed shootouts, rooftop chases, and
        assassination missions – you know, the usual stuff. But this time
        around, it reaches its peak without any weapons drawn.
        <br /><br />
        Black Ops Cold War really sells its, um, black ops Cold War setting
        well. You’ll see ‘80s fashion, plenty of CRT TVs, and a whole lot of
        smoking indoors. It’s authentic! Even better, I love how your choices
        from when you fill out your character’s psych profile actually affect
        gameplay. Your codename is always “Bell,” but you can choose your own
        background and personality traits – and that last one manifests as
        multiplayer-style perks, such as faster reloading speeds or increased
        bullet damage dealt. You can even pick your own name… unless you’re me,
        for some reason?
        <br /><br />
        Black Ops veterans will be greeted by some familiar faces: Woods and
        Mason return from Black Ops 1, though I was a little disappointed that
        neither has a ton to do in the story other than be your sidekick. It is
        some good nostalgia to step back into the boots of Mason at various
        times, though. There are also a couple of new faces, but the bulk of the
        co-star screen time goes to Russell Adler, a living-legend CIA veteran
        slash dead-ringer for Robert Redford who’s recruited you to help stop
        Perseus, a generically nefarious and shadowy evil man whose actions tend
        to topple governments… or worse.
      </p>
      <h2>
        I love how your choices from when you fill out your character’s psych
        profile actually affect gameplay.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        You really get to know your team through the safehouse sequences between
        missions. Here you can review evidence, chip away at secret codes, and
        chat with your fellow spies via dialogue-tree conversations. I very much
        enjoyed this aspect of the campaign, even if none of those conversations
        seem to factor into the endgame in the way that other choices do.
        Meanwhile, combat is your standard Call of Duty stop-and-pop shooting
        gallery, with the same basic-at-best AI the series has always had. There
        is precisely one “special” kind of enemy: an armored goon who’s just a
        bullet sponge. Gadgets are strangely almost nonexistent this time
        around, with one brief R/C bomb car sequence in the first mission and
        that’s it. Weapons are nothing you haven’t seen in COD before.
        <br /><br />
        That said, I was impressed at the ways in which Cold War admirably tries
        to carve out some new space in the Black Ops universe with some new
        mechanics. It succeeds in some ways, such as making collectables
        relevant to gameplay by using them as in-universe evidence to set up
        other missions, thus giving you organic motivation to either find those
        hidden items as you go or replay the missions they’re hidden in before
        advancing. Classic spy tricks like photography and lockpicking factor
        into gameplay too.
        <br /><br />
        Even better, you’ll actually need to examine some of the evidence to
        solve little puzzles before taking certain missions, adding some light
        adventure game-style work to this traditionally trigger-happy series.
        Perhaps more notably, though, there are a couple of moments in this
        campaign that have franchise-altering implications. No spoilers, but I’m
        majorly curious if and how those will be followed up on in all future
        Call of Duty games.
        <br /><br />
        The biggest miss is in how Black Ops Cold War as a whole tries to be as
        twisty with its plot as Black Ops 1 was... and it just doesn’t quite get
        there. I applaud it offering multiple endings, though. I was both
        pleasantly surprised and horrified when I chose a bleak ending to see
        just how far Black Ops Cold War would or wouldn’t go, and...well, let’s
        just say it got really dark. It was much more interesting than the
        good-guy ending I tried afterwards, and I’m now eager to go back and see
        some of the other choices.
      </p>
      <h2>Black Ops Cold War’s best mission involves almost no guns at all.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Furthermore, while it’s fun to dangle a bad guy over the edge of a
        rooftop while you interrogate him, like in the opening scene of Tim
        Burton’s Batman, Black Ops Cold War’s best mission involves almost no
        guns at all. Instead, it’s an undercover romp through an enemy-infested
        government building. If that sounds familiar, it’s because something
        very much like it was the highlight of Call of Duty: World War II back
        in 2017. Yes, there are plenty of KGB goons to stealthily choke out and
        hide in lockers, Hitman-style, but more fun is deciding how you want to
        achieve your objective without firing a shot. You can beeline through
        this or really take your time skulking around to explore every option. I
        recommend the latter.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, a word about Black Ops Cold War's graphics: while I wasn't able
        to get a look at the Xbox Series X or PS5 version in time for this
        review, it is really impressive on mid/high-end PC. Environments and
        faces in particular look excellent. Technically speaking, it's an
        incremental step forward from last year's gorgeous Modern Warfare
        reboot.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Call of Duty’s moment-to-moment gameplay is still primarily a
        well-dressed shooting gallery, but Black Ops Cold War succeeds in making
        its quiet time a defining part of its experience rather than just a deep
        breath between the loud and explode-y sequences. Its story is less
        successful at leaving a Black Ops 1-level mark, but the importance
        placed on finding and deciphering evidence as well as the multiple
        endings give good reason to stick with it beyond its typical
        six-ish-hour runtime.
