      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        There comes a point while playing Prototype 2 when you realize the
        marketing campaign was a lie. The Homecoming trailer weaves this heart
        wrenching story of a soldier who told his family to trust the government
        and how it cost them their lives. With that pain, Sgt. James Heller
        becomes a relatable character and we want to see him use his superpowers
        to exact revenge on those responsible. But that motivation is lost when
        the game starts and Heller begins shoehorning curse words into every
        other sentence. The emotional connection to our protagonist is severed.
        Heller becomes an angry caricature, and Prototype 2 becomes an enjoyable
        but predictable action title.
        <br /><br />
        If you skipped the original Prototype, you won't have an issue jumping
        into the sequel. About 14 months after the events of the first game, New
        York City is once again in the grips of a viral outbreak -- supposedly
        at the hands of Alex Mercer, the antihero of the original title. Heller
        blames Mercer for the death of his family, and through a 14 or so-hour
        game (if you do all the side quests), it's our job to rain vengeance.
        <br /><br />
        The story doesn't get much deeper than that. You'll partner up with
        shady characters throughout the journey, and they'll feed you missions
        that usually end with Heller beating the hell out of a bunch of soldiers
        or mutants. The setup is repetitive, but the action is entertaining.
        <br /><br />
        Prototype 2 gives you five weapons to morph Heller's hands into, and you
        assign two of them to the face buttons. See, Heller's powers -- given to
        him in a WTF moment by Mercer -- allow him to create these tools of
        destruction, leap tall buildings in a single bound, and ingest people so
        he can steal their memories and shapeshift into their forms. He's also
        packing the ability to turn people into bio-bombs. So, know that.
        <br /><br />
        It's a delicious recipe. Leaping into the air, targeting a foe and
        swooping in for a claw attack that beheads the bad guy is fun. Sneaking
        around a base disguised as a solider and absorbing unaware enemies is
        cool. Prototype 2 excels at making you feel like a badass. Completing
        tasks levels you up so you can move faster, fly farther and become
        invulnerable to gunfire. Absorbing specially marked characters upgrades
        your abilities so you can pounce on victims from farther away and
        increase the range of your Whipfist.
        <br /><br />
        With each mission, you feel Heller getting stronger and stronger. Brutes
        that used to be the bane of your existence eventually become your pets
        and the first helicopter you KO with an uppercut will leave you feeling
        like the apex predator of New York City.
        <br /><br />
        On top of that, developer Radical Entertainment nails what work works in
        open world games -- collectables. New York City is broken into three
        zones, and each section has a slew of side tasks to knock out. There are
        infected lairs to clear, teams to kill and blackboxes to find. Although
        you'll need to find these locales, the general areas are marked on your
        map. This is awesome and led to me spending an hour knocking out side
        missions as soon as I stepped foot on each island.
        <br /><br />
        And while that's rad, it kind of points out one the problem with
        Prototype 2. I was playing to complete it -- to get the 14 blackboxes in
        the green zone and to get Heller's tendrils to level four. The grinding
        is fun, but I couldn't have cared less about why this priest had me
        attacking the 400th Blackwatch soldier that looked just like the 40th.
        <br /><br />
        Even though becoming this ultimate killer is cool, it doesn't hide the
        fact that nearly every mission is running into a base, forcefully
        assuming an identity, and exiting the alert. It doesn't hide the fact
        that the animations for many of Heller's moves look like those of the
        nearly 3-year-old Prototype, which look like those of the nearly
        7-year-old The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of the animations, Prototype 2 still doesn't look like a 2012
        blockbuster game. Blackwatch badges are muddy on characters, and
        Heller's absorbing animations are clearly going through his body and not
        into it. The best example of all this comes as a stabbing scene at the
        very beginning. The knife goes into the body, but it's just gliding in
        like it's stabbing air -- the moves have no impact.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Having no impact is kind of the M.O. of Prototype 2. I enjoyed leveling
        up Heller and completing side quests, but none of it really meant
        anything to me. Outside of the Trophies I have for my efforts, I doubt
        I'll remember much of Prototype 2's sterile side missions and curse
        word-laden dialogue. Prototype 2 is fun, but it sure is forgettable.
