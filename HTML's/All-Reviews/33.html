      <span class="author"> BY JON BOLDING </span>
      <p>
        Writing this review hurt my feelings. The Company of Heroes series is
        near and dear to my heart – all three of them are real-time strategy
        games that cut to the core of the genre, focusing on overarching
        strategic decisions coupled with tactical troop movements and a
        battlefield that truly matters. I'm pleased to say that Company of
        Heroes 3 implements those series fundamentals quite well in a gentle
        remix that brings the series to diverse theaters of World War 2 that it
        hadn't touched yet. What I'm very displeased about is that the ambitious
        Italian campaign mode is incredibly disappointing. While individual
        missions and scenarios within the strategic sandbox are strong and even
        thrilling at times, almost every feature on the strategic map doesn't
        work, either because it's bugged or because it's such middle-of-the-road
        game design that it's simply boring.
        <br /><br />
        There are actually two single-player campaigns in CoH3. The larger one
        is the Italian Campaign, a broad, turn-based strategic mode on a large
        map of central and southern Italy that has you capture territory town by
        town, and took me about 25 hours to complete the first time around. It
        has theoretically complex systems in which your armies – called
        companies (with heroes in them) – capture towns and ports using
        deployable air power and naval fleet movements, and build emplacements
        to defend territory or provide offensive bonuses in battles. It's all
        very visually similar to the setup of the Total War series.
        <br /><br />
        Actual battles that break out when two companies collide or you invade a
        town are the highpoint: They’re an exciting mixture of skirmishes with
        dynamic, interjected bonus objectives, shifting modifiers like a fixed
        force of starting units or specific enemy troops you need to counter.
        You might be given a small group of units cut off from the vanguard as
        it defends a position, or thrown into a normal-looking skirmish where
        the enemy has a number of extra troops and pre-fortified positions on
        the map. It's all really fun, and the scenarios are diverse enough that
        I never got bored with them – it's always an interesting surprise when a
        column of damaged enemy armor suddenly appears, or a friendly plane goes
        down and needs rescuing.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Fixed missions are the good stuff we’re accustomed to from Company of
        Heroes campaigns.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Of course there are also fixed missions, a la a traditional RTS
        campaign, that happen when you attack certain towns or reach specific
        regions. These might have you command partisans, liberate a POW camp, or
        play out famous battles like the assault on Anzio and its railway guns.
        All of those are the good stuff we’re accustomed to from Company of
        Heroes campaigns, barring the somewhat-buggy and overblown finale map
        that seems to be more interested in big booms and making you defend
        nauseating chokepoints than anything tactically interesting.
        <br /><br />
        Again, a lot of those missions are excellent, but the shine is taken off
        of them by the fact that they're surrounded by the meaningless campaign
        layer. What initially seems to be a complex system of resource
        management, defensive emplacements, and company types with skill levels
        and support detachments ultimately has little impact on what's happening
        when push comes to shove and you play a skirmish – and it's not even
        clear if that's because of poor game design choices or if it's all
        bugged. I couldn't always tell. Every decision on the campaign map is
        just so low-stakes that it just feels like a waste of time. Did your
        company take some damage from enemy defensive emplacements? That's fine:
        every company can heal itself and still attack on the same turn – not
        that being damaged seems to have any bearing on what happens in a
        skirmish match anyway. Do I start with fewer troops? Lower resources?
        Fewer tickets? It doesn’t say and I couldn't tell.
      </p>
      <h2>Every decision on the campaign map feels like a waste of time.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Even worse, the enemy's companies and assets on the campaign layer are
        incredibly passive. On both medium and hardest difficulties they rarely
        – if ever – counterattacked me outside of clearly scripted moments.
        Otherwise they would happily sit in encircled territory as I took
        objective after objective around them, never making an effort to break
        out. I never once saw an enemy company attempt to conquer even a
        completely undefended town that was right there for the taking.
        <br /><br />
        The Italian campaign simply doesn't work as anything other than a
        miserable framework for delivering skirmishes and missions that the
        previous two games served up better. What may have been a triumphant and
        explosive RTS campaign is instead a massive dud.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Much of that meaningless busywork would be forgivable, even fun, if the
        Italian campaign experiment worked as intended. However, it does not.
        Unit movements and especially aircraft are very strange on the map,
        often doing immediate and strange turn-in-place movement that's jarring
        in a series with otherwise very close emphasis on how things look in
        motion. And that’s on top of the fact that the interface in general is
        confusing and lacks visual flair.
        <br /><br />
        Yes, I said there are two campaigns, so all is not lost… yet. The other
        is North Africa, a more story-driven and traditional, if short, series
        of eight scenarios that takes about six hours to beat. Against the
        overwhelming failure of the Italian campaign, this second one is left in
        a strange place.
        <br /><br />
        You play as Rommel's Afrika Korps, fighting marquee battles from the
        Germans’ very successful campaigns of 1941 and 1942. What’s odd is that,
        interleaved with those scenarios, is the story of the war as narrated by
        a North African Jewish family that has been split apart by the
        German-Italian invasion and conquest, showing how Nazi and Fascisti
        occupation so devastated those communities that they barely exist today.
        These are two interesting stories, but the way they're presented
        alongside each other doesn't work. The juxtaposition is poorly handled,
        failing to show the context of how action in one affects the other. It'd
        be neat as a bite-size prelude to the Italian Campaign, but the story
        falls flat as anything other than some pretty animatics and a series of
        decent RTS scenarios.
        <br /><br />
        If you ignore all of that story and campaign context, which you might,
        the scenario and map design in both North Africa and Italy are actually
        quite good. The maps consistently present fun situations that understand
        how maneuver is at the heart of Company of Heroes firefights. It's so
        much fun to maneuver units from place to place, with infantry vaulting
        over obstacles or diving for cover as vehicles struggle to navigate
        cramped roadways or tanks smash through walls and buildings.
      </p>
      <h2>The Italian maps are particularly great.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The Italian maps are particularly great, emphasizing gaining elevation
        over enemies and forcing the fighting to alternate between fields and
        winding, tight urban environments unlike anything the series has done so
        far. In fact, this may well be the best urban combat I've ever seen in
        an RTS, and the map design is a key part of that in both campaigns.
        Italian maps almost always have a mix of hills, streams, broad
        vineyards, and dense villages or towns. North African maps alternate
        desolate landscape with rocky ridges, wide valleys, and small, densely
        packed settlements. The play and counter-play of diverse tactical
        options is superb: when up against a strong, garrisoned building you can
        use mortars, grenades, smoke, or even direct a close-quarters assault by
        some infantry units to flush out enemies. You can have units go into
        buildings not just as a garrison, but through them – in one door and out
        the other – to outflank enemy positions. The tactical options it opens
        up made me think about engagements in new ways.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately the AI just isn't up to the task of fighting these battles
        in a convincing manner. To its credit, it sometimes makes what seem to
        be clever plays with infantry maneuvering, and it does use all the tools
        available to it – up to and including building assaults and movement
        through tight areas. Those are the exception, however, and even on the
        hardest difficulties the AI is very clearly propped up by artificial
        bonuses and boosted veterancy levels for its units rather than fighting
        any smarter. It's especially disappointing in armored combat, where the
        AI will blissfully charge superior forces into the maw of deadly guns
        rather than adopt safe positions for an easy win in an exchange of fire.
        Those victories never feel earned.
      </p>

        Sound, always a series high-point, is still quite good in Company of
        Heroes 3. It has some of the best unit chatter and voice lines in the
        series on the Allied side: The blended Canadian-American SSF Commandos
        are fun in action, as are the appropriately overpowered and suicidally
        brave Gurkha riflemen. In contrast, the German voices are rather blandly
        written and disappointingly acted, more stereotype than characterful
        dialogue. The crack of rifles and chatter of machine guns is rousing, as
        is the thrum of tank engines… but something about the burst of grenades
        and the firing of the biggest guns lacks the deafening, big-budget
        Hollywood war movie energy I associate with Company of Heroes and CoH 2.
        The soundtrack gets the job done but isn't a big attraction – I have no
        major critique other than that it fades into the background rather than
        uplifts the action.
        <br /><br />
        If the campaigns don’t speak to you, as they did not for me, there’s
        naturally also the skirmish mode. This is your classic RTS set of maps
        and matchups ranging from 1v1 to 4v4, and uses the same cornucopia of
        four well-designed factions and 14 maps as multiplayer.
        <br /><br />
        Speaking of which, CoH3's four skirmish factions stand out as a remix
        of, and set of highlights from, the series' past. For example, the focus
        of the campaigns being earlier in the war leaves some tanks out
        entirely, like the ubiquitous Panther and infamous King Tiger, and draws
        in some famous early-war vehicles like the dual-gunned Grant tank and
        Panzer III. Americans are fast-moving and aggressive, inspired by the
        first Company of Heroes. The British forces are a diverse set of
        straightforward unit types, unlike their prior incarnations as the
        complex faction, and have surprise appearances by some exceptional elite
        units. The regular German Wehrmacht is just as defensive-minded and
        tough as ever, but this incarnation is notably absent their heaviest
        vehicles, instead emphasizing diverse combined arms. Finally, the
        Deutsches Afrikakorps is a mobile, focused force that can both call in
        specialized Italian allies and transition to a hard hitting armored fist
        late-game.
        <br /><br />
        Each of the factions has three sub-specializations giving it an
        alternate flavor – the British, for example, can specialize into an
        armored company with extra-heavy tanks or an Indian artillery regiment
        supported by elite Gurkha rifles. Most notably, the work of diversifying
        how factions spend their resources is a marked improvement from CoH2,
        allowing playstyles like infantry to spend their Fuel resources on
        upgrades rather than vehicles.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a bit annoying that there's no way to experience the unique faction
        designs, scenarios, and abilities of the campaign armies on-demand. You
        can't even play a specific North Africa scenario without the whole
        campaign, let alone pluck a special skirmish type or fixed scenario from
        the Italian campaign. Those are puzzling exclusions.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, no matter how you play you’re likely to be hampered by an
        uncharacteristic lack of polish and attention to detail. For every
        beautifully animated infantryman vaulting over a wall there's an
        absolutely goofy-looking glow around a repairing tank. For every tank
        juddering over uneven ground or dynamically weathered in combat there's
        a weirdly boxy model with subpar textures. Looking back at the quality
        of the first two games it’s just jarring to see. I’m not mad, Company of
        Heroes – I’m just disappointed.
      </p>

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        The core of Company of Heroes 3’s pair of single-player campaigns is
        fun, tactical RTS action of the kind the series is well known for.
        Battles are often spectacular in their use of terrain and the series’
        traditional mix of infantry and armor, and are consistently interesting
        despite the lackluster AI that loves to blunder its way into an
        unconvincing defeat. But its campaigns are both wrapped up in big ideas
        and stories that just don’t work out well. A buggy and frustratingly
        designed dynamic Italian campaign map feels like it’s just wasting time
        between the exciting tactical battles it loosely connects, and the North
        African campaign’s strong missions are strung together by loose stories
        that fail to connect. After the brilliant World War 2 campaigns we’ve
        seen from this series in the past, it’s hard not to be disappointed in
        these.
