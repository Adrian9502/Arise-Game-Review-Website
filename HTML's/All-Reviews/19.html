      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        Over the past week I’ve become intimately familiar with the virtual life
        of a geeky tech-industry maven named Jess, who I gave wide, swishy hips
        and a sly smirk. As of this writing, she has completed the level 10
        programming skill, felt sad once and happy 232 times, WooHooed only nine
        times, and had two kids with the husband she met at a bar. I’m having a
        hard time saying goodbye to her, admittedly, so I have her drinking
        anti-aging potions. I encounter this problem with a lot of Sims games,
        and this time it’s even worse (because a lot of things are better). But
        at the same time, The Sims 4’s lack of features and small world hasn’t
        let Jess live her life to the fullest. Even though it’s fun, it’s a big
        letdown that this sequel doesn’t inspire the same wow factor that The
        Sims 3 did when I first played it years ago.
        <br /><br />
        When I created Jess, I was immediately impressed by the
        appearance-customization options. Picking a Sim’s walk style, which can
        vary from “tough” to “feminine,” does a lot to express personality (and
        it’ll change to a slouch if they’re tired or an “I have to pee” walk
        when their bladders are uncomfortably full). The new Create-a-Sim in
        general is really intuitive, allowing you to push and pull at different
        parts of a Sim’s body in order to get the exact size and shape you’re
        looking for. I’m a huge believer in body positivity and beauty in all
        bodies, so seeing more realistic representations of various body types
        was really encouraging. I gave Jess thick thighs and hips and kept her
        upper body lean, because I finally could.
        <br /><br />
        I was disappointed, however, that I could give her only four total
        traits — three, if you don’t count the trait associated with her
        lifetime aspiration. That’s one fewer than The Sims 3 allows, or two if
        you have the University Life expansion. It turned out to be less of a
        problem than I’d imagined, though, because the addition of emotions
        makes a lot out of a little.
        <br /><br />
        Trying to get Jess a date was my first brush with the new emotional axis
        to Sims’ personalities, a system that successfully supplants traits as a
        more realistic way for Sims to live and interact. I quickly learned that
        Jess, who I gave the “romantic” trait, very easily swung into “flirty”
        feelings. Feeling flirty unlocked several fun interaction options, like
        posing seductively or taking a cold shower to quell thoughts of WooHoo.
        (Pro tip: Use some of the flirty options before jumping straight to
        WooHoo. In the spirit of realism, Sims will get a better mood boost from
        it afterward.) On the other hand, going too long without flirting made
        her “tense,” which opened up another set of actions.
        <br /><br />
        That’s the best thing about emotions in The Sims 4: They provide new
        contextual opportunities to Sims, like being able to tell a
        self-deprecating joke when embarrassed, and make a lot more sense than
        just having static interactions based on personality traits. It was a
        lot of fun to watch an energized Jess “mop like mad!” and kind of
        touching to see her inspired husband tell her about his dreams. It took
        me about 15 hours of playing with my crew of Sims to fully appreciate
        the complexity of Sim emotions, but now I’m really enjoying it.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, to get the most out of these interactions, you need to
        socialize, and to socialize, you need to leave the house. That’s why I’m
        so extremely disappointed with The Sims 4’s small, stifling world –
        every trip, even to a next-door neighbor’s house, brings up a short but
        jarring loading screen. It feels like a high-res version of The Sims 2,
        at least in this sense. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it is a shock to
        the system after exploring an entire town seamlessly in The Sims 3.
        <br /><br />
        Exacerbating that, there are only 10 public venues to visit between the
        two available neighborhoods, and most of them are duplicated. There are
        three variations on bars, two museums, two parks, two gyms, and a
        library, and because the world is so small, it felt like I kept running
        into the same few people no matter where I went. I thought Jess would be
        able to meet new people through work, but nope! Coworkers don’t really
        exist, as far as I can tell, even the ones Jess supposedly flirted with
        at work. In keeping with the tiny neighborhoods, careers are complete
        rabbit-holes – your Sim just vanishes from the curb in front of their
        house when it’s time to go to work. After meeting Jess’ future husband,
        Jamari, and deciding that he was the most eligible bachelor she was
        going to find (he had the “family-oriented” trait), I ended up keeping
        her at the house most of the time, which makes everything feel even
        smaller.
        <br /><br />
        On the bright side, thanks to the new-and-improved Sim multitasking,
        being a bit of a recluse wasn’t so bad. My second Sim creation, Juniper,
        would walk her bouncy self up to Jess’ door and keep her company as she
        worked on one programming project or another. Jess could code while
        chatting with Juniper, then eat while watching TV with Juniper and text
        Jamari while on the toilet (presumably about Juniper). Conversations, it
        follows, have a similar ease of flow. Jamari, a line cook, would come
        home and make food for Jess and Juniper while having a conversation with
        both of them, easily switching between blowing kisses at the former and
        telling jokes to the latter. It’s really nice to not have to micromanage
        Sims’ interactions at every turn, and it’s especially fun to watch where
        these more intelligent conversations go when you’re not interfering. On
        more than one occasion, I’ve watched Sims gain the “embarrassed” emotion
        while chatting because of a misguided romantic advance or a joke that no
        one really got.
        <br /><br />
        Are you ready for a break from the feels? Me too! On the absolutely
        non-emotional side of The Sims 4, Build Mode has been significantly
        improved over The Sims 3’s version. I was particularly excited about
        cabinet and counter customization; you can have super-cool half-counters
        to end a kitchen in a less abrupt way or half-cabinets for over the
        fridge. Trust me, it’s really cool. Probably more universally exciting
        are the ability to pick up entire rooms and move them anywhere on the
        lot without razing them to the ground and rebuilding them, and the
        push-and-pull tool (similar to body mod in Create-a-Sim) which allows
        you to move or resize an entire length of wall all at once. Some of the
        new tools are quirky, however — foundations are now applied
        retroactively, which is cool if you’re like me and don’t feel like
        demolishing an entire house just to add a porch, but they apply to every
        structure on the entire lot. This means no split-levels and no garages,
        but since there aren’t any cars in The Sims 4, the latter isn’t a huge
        deal.
        <br /><br />
        Except no cars in The Sims 4 is a huge deal, because this is supposed to
        be a people simulation, and people very often have cars. People also
        don’t erupt from the bassinet and immediately enter childhood, but Sims
        in The Sims 4 do, since there are no toddlers. The Sims 3’s
        Create-a-Style tool is also history, a bit of a letdown for my interior
        design sensibilities. Granted, I was successfully able to give Jess and
        Jamari a matching, cohesive space-age house with the tools available,
        but I’m still sad that I can’t make cool pajamas in the exact print I
        want or buy a couch in the style I’d like while also picking a nice
        color. Pools, though, are perhaps the most conspicuous and ridiculous
        omission. For a decade-plus they’ve been well-known as the most popular
        way to murder Sims, if you’re into that. Both build options and
        furnishing options seem really barren at this point, but knowing The
        Sims, that will be remedied in one way or another eventually (for a fee,
        of course).
      </p>

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Transitioning from The Sims 3 to The Sims 4 is a little rough. The Sims
        4 seems barren of content and features by comparison, especially with
        regard to the severely limited scope of the world and frequent (but much
        shorter) loading screens and noticeable absence of toddlers, pools, and
        cars. It’s not so much that Maxis didn’t recreate all the same features,
        but rather that there aren’t enough cool new things to replace what’s
        missing. Yet The Sims 4 does succeed in being a deep and complex game
        when it comes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional
        potential. The emotions system and its contextual actions are really
        strong and added to my investment in my Sims as well as my enjoyment
        from watching ridiculousness unfold. Plus, excellent building tools make
        architecture more fun than ever. Overall, it’s a good start to what may
        eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it’s not there yet.
