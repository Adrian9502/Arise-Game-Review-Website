      <p>
        Project: BloodStrike was released early this year. This game is a battle
        royale (BR) type of game that lets you play in a huge map structure with
        different graphics and new tactical weapons. It is interesting to say
        Project: BloodStrike is the same as PUBG and CODM branding games which
        provide their fans BR and MP as well. This year was the emergence of
        new, top, and optimised immersive and FPS games. Same story goes for the
        upcoming game Call of Duty®: Warzone™ Mobile from Activision Publishing,
        Inc.. Every one of these games regardless of their releases has worked
        on their own graphic quality, realistic immersive experience, and
        tactical movements along with the improvements in maps, weapons, and
        bugs. Every pre-register game has to work on its servers and the bugs in
        the beta tests so that players will gain more confidence for the global
        launch to play because they will already know that the developers will
        work on the game so well. Project: BloodStrike is no exception. NetEase
        Games published the first beta test for Project: BloodStrike on Google
        Play Store in February and allowed limited players to join the beta test
        for their valuable feedback. Project: BloodStrike is a first-person
        action shooter game that only focuses on BR with higher graphical
        quality and realistic gameplay. One of the advantages this game brought
        about is the accessibility of high-end and low-end devices that Project:
        BloodStrike can turn the tide of downloading and installing compared to
        the other high graphic games that will be published soon. This article
        will show you more details on the game mechanics, the story, characters,
        and gameplay, and how to pre-register to have a chance of playing
        Project: BloodStrike from others.
        <br /><br />
        This game, like any other fast-paced BR games, has the same category and
        mechanism in regard to killing common enemies. Little we know is the
        fact that Project: BloodStrike is inspired by popular BR games. However,
        this FPS game has more advantages compared to other games mentioned
        earlier.
        <br /><br />
        Project: BloodStrike like any other top BR games has its own unique map
        that you drop down from your flight and start your fight with a pistol.
        One thing you should know is the mechanism of reviving your teammates
        and buying stations. By collecting cash from the map, you can not only
        buy your teammates back the whole game as unlimited respawns but also
        get upgraded weapons and perks to upgrade your operator.
        <br /><br />
        During the beta test, Project: BloodStrike has released 12 weapons that
        categorised as pistols, ARs, SMGs, shotguns, and sniper rifles namely
        Glock, Desert Eagle, M4A1, Ak 47, Vector, KAG-6, URB, INP9, Origin-12,
        MP155, M700, and Kala. These weapons can get cool and fresh skins as
        well. Also, you can design your own weapon built in the loadout drops.
        <br /><br />
        Project: BloodStrike offered 8 special and powerful characters that have
        distinctive abilities in the battlefield unlike other games that design
        characters for the sake of its beauty. This section will be discussed in
        detail in the next part.
        <br /><br />
        There is one important part of the game that separates it from other FPS
        games and it is the graphics. Project: BloodStrike tried to create the
        best graphics design that not only helps low-end devices to play so
        smoothly but also share the ultimate new generation graphics to perform
        better in high-end devices with 120 FPS.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Bloodstrike Story and Operators Skills</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In fact, Project: BloodStrike does not offer a special story unique to
        its gameplay. Instead, it is inspired by other franchises and immersive
        games that incorporate elements from various maps and game modes which
        is BR. In terms of narratives, Project: BloodStrike centres on providing
        their fans with amazing and stunning competitive experiences. While the
        game follows a single line, the core gameplay does not have a story
        campaign. However, the players have to wait for the global launch to see
        if any other modes or story will be added to the game or not.
        <br /><br />
        Characters in the game or operators have special abilities when closing
        to enemies. Project: BloodStrike attached one special skill and ability
        to each operator so that they can deploy obstacles to defend, place
        turrets to assist your teammates while covering behind a wall. There are
        8 operators with their unique characteristics which are as follows:
        <br /><br />
        Ethan (Protection Barrier): By placing a shield in front of himself, he
        can use that cover to his advantage or help his
        <br /><br />
        teammates to revive when they don’t have a self-revive kit.
        <br /><br />
        Jet (Missile Bombardment): A certain circle will be covered in an atomic
        bomb that does not let the enemy run away from it.
        <br /><br />
        ala (Toxic Grenade): He throws a toxic grenade through the enemy so that
        he can take them down so quickly.
        <br /><br />
        Val (Satellite Scan): This operator has the ability of finding the
        enemies within 100 metres near so that you can ambush and knock down
        targets easily.
        <br /><br />
        Hank (Heavy Fire Turret): Other than placing turrets to assist the
        teammates, Hank can collect skill mods from the dead enemy loot boxes to
        upgrade his turret for more fire power.
        <br /><br />
        Spike (Assassination State): He performs the act of assassinating the
        enemies when you are in a close range with them.
        <br /><br />
        Kraken (Abyss): Project: BloodStrike was inspired by Valorant for this
        operator in that this character throws a smoke-like grenade to blind his
        enemies when they get close to him and trap them inside the circle so
        that he can shoot easily without them noticing.
        <br /><br />
        E.M.T (Healing Beacon): he works as a medic and puts a medic box around
        his teammates to heal them up so well.
        <br /><br />
        The close beta test is only available for residents of 15 countries
        which are the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru,
        Colombia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia,
        Malaysia, Singapore, and The Philippines.. After the first release of
        Project: BloodStrike in these areas, its Google Play Store was open for
        only limited players who could join the game for rating and reviewing
        the gameplay. Moreover, there is one more option to get the beta test
        servers is to join Project: BloodStrike official Discord server for
        further information about the second beta test or global launch. In this
        case, if you want to play Project: BloodStrike before the global launch,
        you should head to the Google Play Store on GameLoop or your smartphone
        to pre-register.
