      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        Historically, the battleship never really had its day. There was just
        one major battleship clash in World War I (which ultimately proved
        indecisive) and America's entry into World War II came at the exact
        moment carriers rendered the battleship obsolete. Fortunately for fans
        of these undeniably cool floating weapons platforms, Wargaming.net’s
        World of Warships gives World War II-era naval combat the design balance
        that history so often lacks, creating heavy-metal slugging matches that
        test tactical skill. Carriers can still rain death from above with
        bombers, but they're trapped in a naval cage match where carriers,
        cruisers, battleships, and destroyers all have distinct and important
        roles to play in its free-to-play 12v12 multiplayer fleet battles.
        <br /><br />
        The heart of World of Warships is gunnery. I've probably spent over half
        my time in Warships looking at distant warships through zoomed-in
        gunsights. Fortunately, shooting in this game is a lot more demanding
        than in your typical first-person shooter, or even Wargaming's own World
        of Tanks or World of Warplanes, and involves a whole bunch of skills and
        instincts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Gunnery requires a mix of aim, mathematics, geometry, and attempted
        telepathy.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Early warships are deceptively simple, as they shoot each other from a
        few kilometers apart, and it often seems like combat boils down to
        simply leading you target a little bit and pulling the trigger. But by
        the time you're playing around with your first battleships, gunnery
        requires a mix of aim, mathematics, geometry, and attempted telepathy.
        The biggest warships hit hard, but their mighty guns can only fire a few
        times each minute, meaning that a missed shot leaves your opponent’s
        guns fully operational and you exposed for an eternity. Meanwhile, those
        shots can take something like five to 10 seconds to reach their target.
        An enemy warship can cover an awful lot of ground in that time, and it
        can maneuver to avoid incoming fire, so you have to not only figure out
        where your shots will land in relation to the enemy vessel, but also
        read what the enemy captain is going to do when he sees you fire.
        Torpedo ships like destroyers and light cruisers also have to make these
        calculations as they try to make their slow-moving torpedoes hit home
        against an enemy that sees them coming.
        <br /><br />
        As frustrating as it can be to see long-range shots make their slow
        journey across the sky, only to land far behind their target and a few
        yards short, success makes it all worth it. Correctly anticipating your
        adversary, gauging the distance and travel time of the shots, and
        delivering a crushing salvo that instantly shatters turrets and sets
        fire to the superstructure is unbelievably satisfying. So much went into
        that moment.
        <br /><br />
        All Together Now
        <br /><br />
        Yet battleships and cruisers are only effective when they can actually
        see their opponents and overwhelm them with firepower before the same
        happens to them. This is where World of Warships really begins to sing
        as a team game… and also where it falls down the most on a regular
        basis, thanks to the vagaries of online matchmaking.
        <br /><br />
        Every ship class is dependent on every other ship class. A carrier is a
        sitting duck unless it's protected by the ships with the guns; cruisers
        are more self-sufficient than any other class thanks to their
        versatility, but they're also limited in what they can accomplish
        without support from specialist ships; destroyers can't last five
        minutes under fire, but they can scout, harass, and ambush like no one
        else.
      </p>
      <h2>
        These classes have to work together, and it's a thing of beauty when
        they do.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        For a team to succeed in Warships, these classes have to work together,
        and it's a thing of beauty when they do. When you're on a good team
        you'll see destroyers setting smoke screens to conceal the direction and
        location of your fleet, then start scouting and blind-firing torpedoes
        down likely avenues of enemy approach. Cruisers will range out ahead of
        the battleships to intercept enemy destroyers and locate the main enemy
        force, or they will play rearguard and keep the carriers safe from
        harassment. Battleships will lay a course taking them across a vital
        section of the map so that they can rain death on anyone their teammates
        find, while carriers chase off enemy air attacks with automated fighters
        and send in bombers to exploit opportunities and weaknesses.
        <br /><br />
        Naval Academy
        <br /><br />
        Learning to play each of these roles is a long and interesting process
        because they’re all completely different. A destroyer is all about
        reflexes and nerve as you race through enemy-infested waters, firing
        torpedoes as fast as you can, twisting out the way of return fire, and
        escaping to safety while your allies open fire on the targets you
        scouted. A carrier captain is practically playing an RTS game in the
        middle of the battle. If things go bad in one game, you can always grab
        another one of the ships in your personal fleet and dive into a
        different match in a different role. (This is the same setup the other
        Wargaming games use.)
      </p>
      <h2>
        If a battleship player decides to stray away from the main battle, your
        entire fleet will slowly get shot to pieces
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        But you're still dependent on the other ships to play their role, and if
        a team doesn't coalesce around some overall strategy, World of Warships
        can be an express elevator to Hell. It’s good that a single skilled
        player can't just dominate a game alone, but unlike in World of
        Warplanes, where mistakes tend to results in swift defeat, battles in
        Warships take much longer to play out -- no matter how futile they are.
        Short of abandoning games, these matches can drag on. I've spent 10 or
        15 minutes with my last remaining teammates just waiting for the enemy
        team to find us and kill us, or put us out of our misery by capturing
        our base and winning the match via objectives. If your team’s destroyers
        all go on a suicide torpedo runs at the start of the battle, the bigger
        ships will be left blind almost helpless as the enemy maneuvers around
        them and sneaks in close for kills. If a battleship player decides to
        stray away from the main battle, your entire fleet will slowly get shot
        to pieces because there is nobody who can do the damage necessary to
        take out enemy battleships. If your carrier wastes all its fighters,
        ships will be picked off one at a time by enemy bombers. It only really
        works if people end up - by accident or design - working together.
        <br /><br />
        That's not really a comment on the community. While there are a few
        heedless fools or teamkillers (who don't seem to be weeded out as
        effectively as they should be – I saw the same teamkiller griefing in
        multiple games), most players do try to work together, even if no words
        are spoken.
        <br /><br />
        That said, that focus on teamwork and the clear distinctions between
        classes makes Warships a little richer and more rewarding than, say,
        Warplanes. By Tier 4 in Warplanes, I kind of felt like I'd seen
        everything there was to see - dogfighting with faster and more lethal
        planes isn't THAT different from dogfighting with worse ones. But in
        World of Warships, I’ve had a lot more diverse experiences based on what
        game mode we're playing and what ships have shown up to the battle.
        There is a control point mode in which the two fleets vie for control of
        three strategic locations on the map, and a more traditional
        team-deathmatch in which the two fleets fight either to eliminate each
        other or to capture the enemy's home base (which usually only happens
        after one fleet has been soundly beaten).
      </p>
      <h2>
        Higher-tech ships force me to improve some skills and develop new ones.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Higher-tech ships don't just feel like better versions of the stuff I
        already had, but also force me to improve some skills and develop new
        ones. As the gun-ranges get longer, as the ships get get faster, and as
        more special abilities like air-defense boosts and spotter aircraft
        become more critical to helping your team, World of Warships is
        constantly demanding better shooting, better piloting, and better
        teamwork. Progression is especially rewarding because each ship looks
        sleeker and more beautiful than the last, with boxy, smoke-spewing old
        rust-buckets replaced by long, low greyhounds that seem to knife through
        the water.
        <br /><br />
        I haven't talked about the payment model yet because it does an
        excellent job of staying out of the way. Warships starts to feel like a
        pretty complete package once you've unlocked every ship class. It does
        require a ton of games to climb the tech tree from Tier IV onwards, but
        since I was hopping between tons of different ships, I didn't feel
        stifled. There is one noticeable exception, however: the fact that you
        can only maintain a handful of ships at a time without paying premium
        currency does feel like a bit of a straitjacket, and I definitely felt
        forced into selling some ships before I felt they were played out.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        When it all comes together around two competent teams working together,
        World of Warships is a glorious pre-World War 2 admiralty fantasy come
        to life. This is Wargaming's richest and most rewarding team game to
        date, with the most diverse set of classes and skills of any of its
        games. The irony is that this also means World of Warships is also the
        least consistent of its games, with higher peaks at the cost of lower
        valleys while you wait out games that have already been decided. But the
        view from those peaks more than makes up for those dives beneath the
        waves.
