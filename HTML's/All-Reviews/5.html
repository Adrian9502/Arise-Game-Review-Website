      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        Much like the waistband of MacGyver’s trousers, Immortals of Aveum is a
        gun-free zone. This may sound like a peculiar predicament for a
        first-person shooter to place itself in, but developer Ascendant Studios
        has made it work. How, you ask? Magic. And I’m not being facetious here;
        I mean, literal barrages of brightly-coloured bullets magically blasted
        from the fingertips of a bloke who really puts the war in warlock. An
        unexpected collision of traditional high fantasy adventure with slick
        FPS action, Immortals of Aveum boasts a wonderful backdrop for its
        classy combat and comes with everything I crave in a modern shooter:
        it’s striking to look at, sturdy to play, and it’s strictly
        single-player only.
        <br /><br />
        There are times when Immortals of Aveum feels like Wolfenstein with
        wizards, and others when it feels like Doctor Strange has been
        airdropped directly into Doom. It’s a curious concoction but it’s one
        that works surprisingly well, and I’ve particularly enjoyed how
        different Aveum is to anything I’ve played in recent memory. The
        firefights are frantic and visually spectacular, the light platforming
        and puzzle work is generally satisfying, and the world itself is very
        well-crafted.
      </p>

        interesting extremes.

      <p>
        Aveum’s arcanepunk aesthetic is very absorbing and creates a world of
        interesting extremes; it’s a world where magic is ubiquitous and powers
        highly-advanced technology for war-torn societies still living a
        medieval-inspired lifestyle. This means wild flying machines and
        mindbending virtual puzzle rooms juxtaposed against gilded castles and
        ramshackle timber slums. It’s a cool clash of styles, and straddling
        multiple genres seems to suit Aveum’s ambitions as a first-person
        shooter with a twist.
        <br /><br />
        We play as Jak who, in a moment of extreme stress in the opening phase
        of the story, is suddenly revealed to possess the power of a Triarch –
        an extremely rare person able to wield the world of Aveum's three forms
        of magic simultaneously. Jak subsequently finds himself drafted into the
        Everwar – a battle for control over Aveum’s magic that has been raging
        for millennia but appears to be barrelling towards a catastrophic
        conclusion. The story specifics get a little lost in the weeds during
        occasional salvoes of fantasy phrases but it’s otherwise easy to follow
        – and there’s a steady cadence of moderate twists to keep it from
        getting bogged. If you want to get seriously steeped in lore there’s a
        lot of optional stuff to dig through, but it definitely isn’t required
        to sufficiently understand what’s going on. There are some very elegant
        ecological and social parables tucked in here, too, and I ultimately
        appreciated the contemporary relevance – and that the story wasn’t just
        spinning its wheels mindlessly.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve noticed some resistance to the choice to use modern vernacular and
        colloquialisms in Aveum’s dialogue, but I honestly can’t see myself
        being as engaged as I was if Ascendant had opted instead for po-faced,
        pseudo–Early Modern English. In fact, I’d argue that leaning on archaic
        language would only undermine how otherwise fresh and modern Aveum feels
        in the first-person shooter space. Not every line lands – and there’s a
        certain Generation Z angst about Jak that I didn’t always find entirely
        endearing – but the performances are good and I can get behind it
        broadly. Besides, I don’t know about you, but I don’t know that I need
        all my fantasy stories sifted through a Shakespeare filter just to dress
        up the dialogue with some 400-year-old dribble.
      </p>
      <h2>
        I don’t know that I need all my fantasy stories sifted through a
        Shakespeare filter just to dress up the dialogue with some 400-year-old
        dribble.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        On default difficulty, Aveum kept me busy for well over 20 hours to
        reach the credits. It’s nicely paced and strikes a good balance between
        switching up our surroundings for new locations and returning us to
        places we’ve already visited. While there are a few drab and dreary
        spots, most of Aveum’s environments are exceptionally good looking –
        from its giant lava pools to its icy and jagged crystal caves. The
        excellent lighting is regularly a strong component of what makes Aveum’s
        levels so eye-catching.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a relatively linear experience and not a single open world, but
        there are some maps that are admittedly quite large and primed for
        exploring off the main path. There were definitely occasions I found
        myself slightly frustrated at Jak’s inability to leap on and over
        surfaces that look entirely suitable for standing on, but my bigger
        frustration was the lack of communication around things Jak couldn’t
        access yet by design. For instance, Aveum was very quick to have Jak
        drop an audio solution to an environmental puzzle I was already well on
        top of solving, but it’s also content to leave me fruitlessly trying to
        figure out how to get into a bonus area Jak literally hasn’t been
        rewarded with the ability to do yet.
        <br /><br />
        Jak’s list of abilities is, however, impressively long. They’re also
        rationed out until quite deep into the story, meaning things that might
        have stumped us hours and hours prior may suddenly make sense. Aveum
        feels a little plain at first, when Jak is limited to just his initial
        basic spell strikes, but as the story progresses he gains access to far
        more interesting attacks and abilities. These include things like sticky
        charges that have a slow-motion effect, the ability to hover after a
        double jump, and a lash that drags enemies in for an easier close
        quarters kill. Aveum is undoubtedly a lot more than a disguised military
        shooter with finger guns.
        <br /><br />
        The finger guns are a fun touch, though, and they’re essentially split
        into three categories. Blue magic attacks function as a large calibre
        pistol, green magic attacks manifest as rapid fire SMG rounds, and red
        magic attacks are essentially a sawn-off shotgun. Red attacks are
        reloaded by fist pumping, by the way. Now we know what Tiger Woods is
        doing every time he sinks a putt.
        <br /><br />
        However, if you’re worried this means there are only three basic
        “weapons” in Aveum, don’t be; there are variations on each that change
        their damage, fire rate, and shots per reload depending on the
        associated “sigil” you equip to Jak’s arm, and there’s also another
        layer of secondary attacks – from damaging blastwaves to snaking volleys
        of magic missiles. There’s even an extremely potent beam that combines
        all three magic colours in a single, destructive torrent – gushing
        forwards like someone just knocked Cyclops’ sunglasses off. I really
        enjoy how powerful this attack makes Jak feel, and it’s crucial in some
        of the tougher boss battles.
        <br /><br />
        Aveum does motivate us to engage with discovering and experimenting with
        new sigils, although it also didn’t punish me for settling with the ones
        I had already fully upgraded and sticking with them until the end of the
        story.
        <br /><br />
        There’s a significant degree of controller gymnastics required to get
        the most of Aveum’s combat. I would also say that, as a man with the
        multitasking abilities of a peanut, it certainly grazes the upper limit
        to the amount of systems I can effectively juggle at once. At its most
        hectic I was nursing multiple ability cooldowns, boosting both my health
        and mana levels, switching sigils depending on which enemy poses the
        most immediate threat, and slinging special spells to deal out the
        fastest damage I can – all while building my big beam attack.
      </p>
      <h2>
        At times, I felt on top of [combat]; at other times things descended
        into panicked blasting. The strength of Aveum is that it all looks
        rather spectacular either way.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        At times, I felt on top of it; at other times things descended into
        panicked blasting. The strength of Aveum is that it all looks rather
        spectacular either way. Whether you’re efficiently and ruthlessly
        carving through enemies with focus and finesse – or wading into battle
        spamming spells and seeing what works – combat is a wild storm of
        shattering shields and colourful fireworks at a welcome 60 frames per
        second on consoles. Movement is smooth, and Jak feels agile and
        responsive compared to the bulk of his foes. Jak is by definition one of
        the most dangerous battlemages in all of Aveum, and I certainly felt
        like that most of the time.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter
        that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its
        fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and
        spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign
        packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped.
        As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player
        shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of
        making sure they’re definitely not dead yet.
