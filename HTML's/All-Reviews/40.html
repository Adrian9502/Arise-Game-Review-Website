      <p>
        Microsoft Flight Simulator is the most incredible experience I've ever
        had on a computer. The realism, the depth, the almost limitless
        replayability – it's like nothing I've ever played before. It does so
        much to recreate the feeling of actual flight, at a level of accuracy
        never before seen, that there were times when I came in for a landing at
        real-life airfields I'd seen during my time in the Air Force where I was
        simply stunned. These are places I will likely never visit again as a
        civilian, and yet as I gazed out the window during my final descent into
        places like Jacobabad, Pakistan or Thumrait, Oman, I was seeing an
        approximation so close to what I remembered from all those years ago
        that I actually said out loud, "Holy shit, I remember this."
        <br /><br />
        The attention to detail in the plane interiors, rebuilt virtually using
        laser scans of the real things, manufacturing documents, and CAD
        drawings, is astonishingly precise. But it's the integration with
        Microsoft's real-world Bing map services that takes this incredible
        simulation into a whole new realm of freedom and realism. Granted, there
        are a few cracks in the picture-perfect facade in some of the more
        remote areas, and the buildings outside of major cities are built
        largely with a clever algorithm instead of by human hands, but it's
        still absolutely wild how complete it seems. If you want to fly over
        your house, it's there, in Flight Simulator, exactly where it ought to
        be. It might not look exactly like your house, but it's there. I
        promise.
        <br /><br />
        The base version of Microsoft Flight Simulator comes with 20 planes and
        30 hand-crafted airports. That might not seem like a lot of locations,
        but the remaining 37,000+ of the world’s airports are generated using
        technology sufficiently advanced that, to my eye, it is
        indistinguishable from magic. My local airport on the east coast of the
        United States, for example, is tiny and largely unremarkable, but I was
        impressed by how close to the mark Flight Simulator came while I was
        taxiing to park my Cessna. Every building is in the right place, aside
        from a few of the smaller (less than 10x10') outbuildings. It's quite
        impressive.
        <br /><br />
        The hand-crafted airports, built from scans and real-world blueprints,
        are even more technically awe-inspiring – I’ve never seen anything close
        to this level of accuracy in a flight simulation before. What I really
        like is how developer Asobo Studios expanded the selection of "hand
        crafted" recreations beyond just the major airports. Sure, major hubs
        like JFK, Seattle-Tacoma, and Heathrow are lovingly recreated in the
        base game, but smaller airports are also here. There's even one in South
        America that's no more than a strip of dirt cutting a swath through the
        thick rainforest. I wasn't expecting to find such accuracy for these
        tiny, more challenging destinations, but I loved discovering them.
        <br /><br />
        In a similar vein are the airplanes themselves – the level of detail is
        astounding. I can say from real-world experience the cockpit of the
        Cessna 172 Skyhawk is perfect. You could snap a screenshot and share it
        online as a photo and, unless your PC is a complete potato, it would
        easily fool a lot of people. (I know this because I did exactly that.)
        Asobo not only flawlessly recreated the look of the interiors and
        exteriors of the available planes, but the instruments are also fully
        operational. The Garmin digital instruments appear and function exactly
        as they do in real life because the developers built emulators for the
        actual software that runs them into Flight Simulator. This is the first
        game I've ever played where I downloaded a .PDF manual from a real-world
        piece of equipment to reference during play – and everything in the
        manual checks out to the virtual hardware. It excites the absolute
        nerdiest parts of my core.
      </p>

      <p>
        As unbelievably realistic as the flight simulation is, it's also
        accessible to just about anyone's level of flight experience. You can
        turn on all the assists and enjoy Flight Simulator in a more
        arcade-style, or turn them all off and approach a virtual sortie in the
        same way you’d do the real thing, checklists and all. As someone without
        a pilot’s license (I was an electrician in the Air Force, not a pilot)
        my personal preference is playing halfway between the full simulation
        and the highest assist settings because it still creates a very
        challenging experience but removes some of the mundane steps from the
        process, like pre-flight checks, engine start, etc.
        <br /><br />
        Better still, since Flight Simulator is coming to Xbox Series X at some
        as-of-yet-undetermined point in the future, it controls really well with
        just an Xbox One controller. The elevator controls are a little touchy
        on some of the planes using the analog stick, but can be adjusted to
        suit your needs. Overall, I have no complaints about playing with the
        controller. It still requires keyboard functionality to get the most out
        of your plane, but there's no immediate need to rush out and buy a
        flight stick or yoke.
        <br /><br />
        That being said, the simulation is much more authentic and enjoyable if
        you do have access to a dedicated flight controller. I used
        Thrustmaster's new Airbus A380 flight stick, in addition to my time with
        the Xbox controller, and it makes flying that much more immersive. Even
        planes with yokes are better with a flight stick, so if you have the
        means and if you can actually find one, I recommend picking up a
        dedicated controller for the full Flight Simulator experience. Just keep
        in mind it's not a requirement, which is a great feature for those of us
        who’d rather dabble in flying than make a big hardware investment.
        <br /><br />
        The 20 planes and 30 hand-crafted airports in the $60 base version of
        Microsoft Flight Simulator are already a respectable amount of content.
        These aircraft run the gamut from highly maneuverable stunt planes like
        the Aviat Pitts Special S2S biplane, to wide-bodied airliners like the
        "Queen of the Skies" herself, the Boeing 747-8. However, if you’re
        hungry for more, the $90 Deluxe Edition adds five more planes and five
        airports, and the $120 Premium Deluxe Edition adds another five of each,
        for a total of 30 different aircraft and 40 airports. The variety is
        excellent, although as an Air Force vet I was a little disappointed that
        there are no military aircraft. I was holding out hope I'd get to fly a
        C-130 (my favorite airplane of all), or a C-17. A military trainer like
        the jet-propelled T-38 would also have been an exciting addition, or
        even a ViperJet. If you want to fly a jet aircraft the only option right
        now is a passenger plane, and that's a bit of a bummer – but certainly
        not a deal breaker. I’m not trying to knock the already impressive
        selection here, either, I'm just being greedy.
        <br /><br />
        With that said, I was perfectly content with the 20 planes included with
        the base game, and I don't really see the need to upgrade unless you
        feel you absolutely must get behind the controls of a 787-10 Dreamliner
        or a Cessna 152 or 172 variant.

      <p>
        Even with medium assists turned on, getting off the ground and back
        again in one piece requires a lot of planning, careful maneuvering, and
        tons of practice. There is a built-in "flight school" that puts you in
        the pilot seat of the Cessna 172, and it’s great. It helped me a lot
        with terminology, best flight practices, and getting used to handling
        the aircraft. By the time I finished all the flight lessons, I felt
        completely confident in my abilities controlling the Cessna and its
        maneuvers. The other planes operate under the same basic principles, but
        some of them, particularly the airliners like the A320neo and the 747,
        require a lot of familiarizing if you even want to attempt a landing
        without a disaster. I wish there was more aircraft-specific training
        available for the other planes in the fleet, but there is a pretty smart
        AI you can hand the controls to at any time during your flight. I was
        able to learn a lot about the proper approach angle and landing speeds
        just from watching my AI pilot take over. (I expect YouTube tutorials
        will become a thriving genre as well.) And besides, if just flying for
        the sake of flying is your goal, you can always turn on the assists to
        make it easier.

      <p>
        All of that gorgeous detail and accurately modeled equipment is on the
        inside, but the absolute genius of Microsoft Flight Simulator is
        actually outside the planes, enabled by its Bing Maps integration. Two
        petabytes (that’s 2,000 terabytes) of satellite and high-altitude
        photography are available to stream to your computer to accurately
        represent whatever part of the globe you decide to visit. The effect is
        absolutely mindblowing: I've flown places I've never been in my life,
        circling Machu Picchu or barnstorming between the Great Pyramids, and it
        feels like virtual sightseeing. But I've also flown to places I have
        visited just to relive the travel experience, and have been thoroughly
        impressed. More than once I've set off from my local airport and
        followed real-life roads through the Maine woods and into Quebec,
        retreading (re-winging?) the route I took last year by car. I've also
        landed on the tiny dirt airstrips in some of Maine's remote inhabited
        islands, taking in the familiar scenery from 2,500 feet above the
        Atlantic Ocean.
        <br /><br />
        You can even fly in real-world weather conditions with live air traffic,
        all of which is adjustable with in-game menus that are easily accessible
        during flight. If you've ever wanted to take off from an airport in a
        driving snowstorm at night, you can set the weather and time to your
        liking. One of my favorite things to do when flying is to adjust the
        time of day to the "golden hour," early mornings or just before dusk
        when the sun's rays are at their warmest and most pleasant. It makes for
        some incredible sights.
        <br /><br />
        The limitations of the Bing integration come in two distinct
        circumstances: if your internet service provider has a data cap, and
        when the existing aerial photography of an area happens to be
        low-resolution. In the case of the data cap problem, you can preinstall
        locations ahead of time, so you load one small chunk of data rather than
        opening up the data firehose. Asobo seems to be sympathetic to this
        hazard and offers a setting in the menus to track your data use and set
        an upper limit so you don't go over your cap. After a few hours of play,
        including flights over San Francisco and New York City, I only used a
        few megabytes of data, but multiply that over a few hours a day over the
        course of a month (and flying over less frequently traveled areas) and
        it could become concerning. (Also, that comes after you install this
        150GB monster of a game!)
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The second limitation is with low-resolution maps, which show up in some
        of the more remote corners of the Earth, but it’s only really noticeable
        at low-altitudes. Personally, I find the thrill of flying a few feet
        above the Colorado river more than enough to compensate for the lack of
        texture details on the walls of the Grand Canyon. Also, since the data
        is pulled directly from Bing, low-resolution areas will improve as its
        database of imagery improves over time. At the moment, though, some
        places do look decidedly… PlayStation 1… when you're up close and
        personal.
      </p>
      <h2>Friendly Skies</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The act of flying and exploring some far-flung corner of the Earth is
        more than enough to keep me entertained, but Flight Simulator adds some
        competitive elements, including landing challenges. A rotating selection
        of remote and challenging airstrips become a place to showcase your
        landing skills, with scores being assigned to your performance in
        categories like accuracy on the runway, roll distance, and bounce. It's
        actually a really fun way to increase your skills, and I’ve spent a lot
        of time trying to land successfully on a mountaintop airfield in France.
        Will I ever top the leaderboards on these challenges? Well, for now,
        yeah. I actually have a few of the world's top-scores for some of the
        landing challenges. Will this trend hold once the game comes out? No.
        God no. But will I continue trying to improve my scores? My inner
        competitor demands that I must!
        <br /><br />
        Naturally, many of those attempts will end with you damaging or even
        outright crashing your plane. You might think you're making a last-ditch
        effort to put your plane on the ground, only to discover (like I did)
        the landing gear on a heavy like the Airbus A320neo isn't designed for
        non-tarmac use. For obvious reasons, a crash doesn’t result in a
        realistic fireball, but rather a black screen and a pop-up window that
        alerts you to your shameful performance – as if you didn’t already know.
        It's not just crashes that cause instant failure: taking a plane well
        beyond its physical limitations, like an over-speed scenario, will also
        end your flight before you actually hit the ground. I found this out
        while first trying to do a barrel roll in a 747 and ended up descending
        too fast. That's not to say you can't do some sick stunts: you
        absolutely can make that 747 execute a successful barrel roll with a
        little practice – I did it a LOT, actually. It's just you can't make a
        plane do more than it could do in real life.
      </p>

        Performance wise, Flight Simulator looks great on my PC, which is no
        slouch but a few years old at this point. I'm running a Core i7-7700K
        with a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU and 32GB of RAM. Microsoft Flight Simulator
        set itself to "high" when I initially started up, but I did find myself
        turning down some of the lighting effects to medium to improve
        performance. That made it steady, for the most part, except that loading
        into one of the larger airports near a major city slowed things down to
        a crawl, particularly when I tried to fly one of the bigger airplanes.
        However, the stuttering frame rate always mellowed out to a nice,
        pleasant clip after a few seconds, making for a smooth flight.
        <br /><br />
        Where my PC really struggles with Microsoft Flight Simulator, and I
        suspect this will be a problem for most people, is loading times. Big
        airports take a long time, sometimes as much four minutes in the case of
        Chicago O'Hare. Even remote airports with far less going on take at
        least a minute. I'm certain it's not my PC’s fault, because I installed
        Microsoft Simulator on a 1TB WD Blue M.2 NVMe SSD, and it’s hard to get
        a lot faster than that right now. It's not surprising given the
        staggering amount of data Microsoft Flight Simulator has to load, but
        it's still impossible to ignore all that time you spend twiddling your
        thumbs.
        <br /><br />
        As frustrating as the loading times can be, once you're into an area it
        only takes a few seconds to restart if you crash or manually reset your
        flight. Personally, I didn't mind the wait too much – it represents only
        a fraction of the total time I spent in the cockpit.
        <br /><br />
        It also should be pointed out that, at launch, Flight Simulator doesn’t
        support VR, but Microsoft says it’s coming in a patch later this year.
        Just the thought of being able to play Flight Simulator in virtual
        reality has me seriously considering upgrading to a new headset. As
        incredible as it looks and feels on just my monitor, I really want to
        immerse myself in the experience as much as humanly possible.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Microsoft Flight Simulator is legitimately incredible. It's difficult to
        fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and have the
        freedom to fly to and from literally any place in the entire world. The
        base game's 20 included aircraft feel like more than enough for even
        hardcore aviation enthusiasts, and the ability to adjust the assists to
        tailor the experience to whatever skill level you desire makes it
        suitable for anyone looking to fly the friendly skies from the comfort
        of their home. The real-world mapping data, however, takes Microsoft
        Flight Simulator from being just an impressive game to the most
        awe-inspiring simulation I've ever experienced, in spite of its less
        than stellar load times. Seeing famous landmarks, landing at the world's
        most recognizable airports, or just touching down in a remote landing
        strip in South America is mind-bogglingly cool and an absolutely
        unparalleled way to virtually explore our world.
