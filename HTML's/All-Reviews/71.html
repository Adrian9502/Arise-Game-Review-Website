      <p>
        What’s in a name? When EA announced it would change the title of its
        premiere soccer series from FIFA to EA Sports FC24, we all wondered: is
        this also the year it finally takes a real step forward, out of the
        microtransaction-focused darkness and into the light of its full
        potential? Well, the answer is a resounding… kind of. There are
        breadcrumbs of greatness in EA Sports FC 24, with many new mechanics
        like Evolutions and Tactical Visions showing the series can evolve into
        something better. Yet, for every exciting improvement added in, there's
        still far too many of the same things, like poor AI, that have
        frustrated me for years.
        <br /><br />
        For the first few hours of EA Sports FC 24, everything feels familiar
        gameplay-wise, for better and for worse. HyperMotion V and the
        PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller feedback return make matches
        realistic, with precise ball and player physics, noticeable field wear
        and tear, and goal post-shaking haptics. It's hard to deny that there's
        a lot of attention to detail going into recreating a realistic soccer
        atmosphere.
        <br /><br />
        New overlays showcase useful statistics like shot volume and player
        fatigue mid-game, with numerous background interview segments laced
        throughout matchday's pre, mid, and post-game segments as well. While
        they don’t feature any actual interactions with players and
        interviewers, it’s one of the many noticeable bits of detail that add to
        the atmosphere. If you foul someone to set up a free kick, you’ll even
        get a neat little first-person setup from the ref’s perspective, just
        like you’d see during a live broadcast. At the same time, team walkouts
        and ceremonial songs have sadly been cut, replaced by a few different
        shots of either fans or players getting ready for game day. It's a shame
        that I can take a League Two side like Wrexham all the way to the
        Premier League and still not get to hear their glorious anthem or see
        them walk out during their debut on the grandest stage of them all.
      </p>
      <h2>The AI part of Hypermotion V doesn't live up to the hype.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence part of the Hypermotion V
        technology that has been so heavily advertised doesn't live up to the
        hype. While Kinetic Shielding makes for some exciting battles, players
        still fall all over each other in unnatural ways. Advanced machine
        learning, which is pretty much a fancy way of saying constantly
        improving AI, is also hit-or-miss. Your goalkeepers will sometimes stand
        sideways and let an easy shot in or punch a ball that could have been
        caught, AI teammates make terrible attacking or defensive decisions that
        would have Harry Maguire blushing, and you'll likely find yourself
        yelling about an incorrect passing input more than once a match despite
        knowing you angled a perfect through ball with your sticks.
        <br /><br />
        It’s frustrating that these issues are still a part of the series, but
        there are changes that help ease the pain of dealing with them, most
        notably Playstyles. As the name suggests, Playstyles customize every
        player's method of play to fit their specific strengths and weaknesses.
        As a result, no two players control the same way, adding a fresh layer
        to gameplay and how you approach team management. It’s genuinely
        impressive how EA has managed to capture each player’s likeness, as you
        can bully opponents off the ball and rip through nets with Erling
        Haaland's Power Shot or finesse passes and set pieces with James
        Ward-Prowse’s Dead Ball approach.
      </p>
      <h2>
        No two players control the same way, adding a fresh layer to gameplay.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        When creating your own customized player's Playstyle, you'll sift
        through 32 abilities spread across six categories: Shooting, Passing,
        Defending, Ball Control, Physical, and Goalkeeping. While it might seem
        simple at first, each one has a lot of unique sub-abilities to sort
        through that determine your character’s build, making a world of
        difference when it comes to tailoring your preset skills to work
        alongside your specific manner of play.
        <br /><br />
        Since I always create a Forward player that dominates the middle of the
        pitch, getting the Tiki Taka attribute makes controlling the middle of
        the pitch with quick passes to teammates a breeze, especially when
        coupled with First Touch, which makes getting and controlling the ball
        for the first time while under pressure more possible. With the ability
        to control the ball perfectly, my character can open up the field with
        wide through balls that get played right back into him or teammates to
        create a lot of chances on goal.
        <br /><br />
        Alongside Playstyles, you can now go into the settings and turn on an
        option to control the direction of your passes and shots, replacing the
        previous Precision system. Shots are more on target while using the left
        stick to aim and general passes and lobs can be directed to exact
        locations. Mastering these techniques won't come without a bit of
        practice, but they open up the possibility of making creative runs,
        especially when working with other players.
        <br /><br />
        Thankfully, the updated practice arena has more depth in EA Sports FC24
        than it ever did in FIFA, adding in Scenarios that new players and
        veterans alike would be wise to check out. You can try out specific set
        pieces here, or nail down what Playstyle works best for you in drills or
        even full-on matches. Putting your pride aside and playing here to get
        the hang of the controlled shots and passes is worth it in the long run,
        as you can run experiments in a much quicker and more efficient manner
        than you’d be able to by playing full games thanks to the sheer amount
        of control you’re given.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Go into Ultimate Team knowing full well that it always feels inherently
        unfair.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Once you've got your style nailed down, it's time to dive into the real
        reason EA Sports FC 24 is as popular as it is: its trading-card game
        mode, aka Sports Yu-Gi-Oh, aka FUT, aka Ultimate Team. As always, you'll
        need to go into Ultimate Team knowing full well that it always feels
        inherently unfair because people who are willing to spend real money on
        microtransactions to get packs will have a much better squad in a
        shorter amount of time than someone who doesn’t. The name of the game is
        still that quantity results in quality, and microtransactions pay for
        quantity. While it’s aggravating that grinding or paying the big bucks
        are still your only two options for significant progress, improvements
        elsewhere help deliver one of the best Ultimate Team experiences to
        date, even if you don’t pay.
        <br /><br />
        Evolutions in Ultimate Team allow you to take the base stats of cards
        and improve them by completing challenges, as long as they fit the
        criteria, which vary from stats like Overall, Pace, and Rarity.
        Manchester United lovers no longer have to wait to see Alexander
        Garnacho's potential fulfilled, taking him from a Left Wing 75 rating to
        a Relentless Winger 82 rating thanks to the Founders Evolution. To do
        this, you’ll simply complete objectives that are broken down into
        levels. Finish a group of requirements in a level, and you’ll get a stat
        boost reward. What’s nice is that completing these objectives isn’t as
        brutal as previous games in the series (yes, I’m talking about you, FUT
        20), as most just ask you to complete matches with your EVO player.
        Getting to improve players you draw instead of just praying for a good
        pull is an enticing incentive to play Ultimate Team for the long term.
        <br /><br />
        Another leap forward for this mode is the addition of over 19,000 fully
        licensed players, 700 teams, and 30 leagues from the women’s soccer
        divisions to Ultimate Team; FIFA 23 only had 12 NWSL teams and four
        stadiums by comparison. EA Sports FC24 not only lets you play as
        everyone from Sam Kerr to Kadidiatou Diani, but it makes men's and
        women's statistics equal. That means Nadine Kessler is able to body
        players off the ball the exact same way that Adama Traore can, making
        for some wild mixed-gender matchups and lineups.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Volta didn't change up too much, but it's the mode I had the most fun
        with.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The other, often overlooked stepchild multiplayer mode in EA Sports FC
        24, Volta, didn't change up too much, but it's the one I had the most
        fun with. Sure, there will be matches where someone is idle or is a
        complete ball hog, but the ones where you link up with compatible
        players bring back fond memories of FIFA Street. Few things are more
        satisfying than wall bouncing to a teammate who dekes around the keeper
        after a great build-up that leads to scoring multiple points. Since
        chemistry is so important, it’s recommended that you try and round up a
        solid squad of four friends if you want to get the most enjoyment and
        best results out of Volta. Stadium variety also adds quite a bit of
        variety to matches, with some featuring larger goals and others having
        higher walls to bounce the ball off. It’s a welcome bit of diversity to
        help prevent each game from feeling too repetitive.
        <br /><br />
        By comparison, the single-player focused Career Modes are a considerable
        letdown. Player journeys are once again riddled with a poor excuse for
        role-playing, with FIFA 23's Personality Points rearing their ugly head
        again. Honestly, I can't imagine anything screaming 'I love soccer' more
        than purchasing a Jetski to earn 50 “Maverick” points that will result
        in my player being a more aggressive shooter. The addition of Player
        Agents and Dynamic Moments show some potential to help flesh out the
        mode and make it a more fun RPG, but even those fail to stick the
        landing.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        While the idea of meeting certain goals via a Player Agent to get a
        transfer or renewed contract from your dream squad sounds nice in
        theory, some of the objectives are insane. You can have a Ballon d'Or,
        60-plus goal season, and still be released from contract because you
        didn't hit five bicycle kicks in any of them. Yeah, sorry, Messi – we
        know you broke the record for most goals scored in a campaign, but we
        had to let you go because you didn't get enough Scorpion Kick goals as
        you were doing it. What?
        <br /><br />
        The whole thing sours what could have been a really great way to make up
        for the lack of being able to choose your own path and direction that
        has weighed down previous Career Modes. Dynamic moments also fail to
        capture the weight and gravity of situations fully, as you can only
        watch the same cutscene so many times before wondering where the
        story-based content of FIFA 17's Alex Hunter has gone.
        <br /><br />
        Manager Mode is a little more interesting in EA Sports FC 24, mostly due
        to the seven tactical identities that your coach can apply to their
        club. Tactical Vision is what Playstyles are for an individual, just
        applied to a whole team instead. Pick the more defensive-minded Park the
        Bus option for a great defense, or use Tiki-Taka to control the middle
        of the field. I always prefer Wing Play, as nothing beats charging down
        the field and crossing it into an open net. Even then, there isn’t much
        that has changed in this Career Mode either, as single-player once again
        feels like an afterthought, cowering in the long shadow cast by Ultimate
        Teams.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        If you were hoping for a dramatic reinvention of EA’s soccer sim to go
        along with ditching the FIFA name, EA Sports FC 24 is not that. If
        you’ve played FIFA, you know exactly what kind of incremental
        improvements and longstanding problems with AI to expect this year. New
        mechanics like Evolutions show that EA has a general grasp of how to
        improve its RPG elements, even if it’s only currently for Ultimate Team
        where you have to put up with all of the dreaded microtransactions.
        Elsewhere, Volta mode is still a lot of fun with a full team of friends
        thanks in part to its unique arenas, while the Career Modes once again
        suffer from the same lack of care they’ve been missing for years, with
        the added annoyance of some ill-conceived RNG-based objectives this
        time. All told, it might have a new name, but EA Sports FC 24 is just
        about the same, frustrating but beautiful game.
