      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        It’s been two years since Death Stranding’s release; in that time, the
        PS4 and PC versions of Kojima’s backbreaking delivery man simulator have
        gone on to sell more than five million copies combined, making it a
        success by any measure. However, anecdotally I’ve come across just as
        many people who have played Death Stranding and completely loved it as I
        have people who’ve bounced off it within its intentionally grueling
        opening hours. It’s the latter group of people who perhaps wanted to
        like it but couldn’t, along with any other fence-sitters, that this
        PlayStation 5 Director’s Cut seems to have in mind; its raft of
        quality-of-life improvements and player-friendly features added
        specifically to make more manageable molehills out of its many
        formidable mountains. It's just odd that so many of these concessions
        seem to directly contradict the deliberate hard-working spirit that many
        appreciated about the original version, which makes the Director’s Cut
        feel somewhat... compromised.
        <br /><br />
        The new firing range is definitely a welcome inclusion. Accessed via the
        terminal at any distribution center, it allows you to get to grips with
        every weapon – and each of them now feels more distinct thanks to the
        subtle feedback afforded by the DualSense’s adaptive triggers. On top of
        just blasting paper targets, there are around 30 different VR drills in
        which you compete against the clock – from stealth-slicing umbilical
        cords through a gauntlet run of BTs to making fools out of MULEs using
        only grenades. These are enjoyable little challenges in their own right,
        but more importantly, they allow you to get a feel for Death Stranding’s
        combat without the risk of losing any precious cargo that comes with
        trying to learn to fight while you’re out on the job.
        <br /><br />
        The firing range may provide a safe space to master Death Stranding’s
        fighting, but it’s not as game-changing as the buddy bot and cargo
        catapult. Previously only glimpsed in cutscenes or employed unseen for
        automated deliveries, the buddy bot can now be used in a number of
        different ways: it can strut along behind you carrying crates, leaving
        Sam unencumbered and less prone to losing his balance; or you can load
        it up with a shipment, slap it on its sassy robot arse, and watch it
        sprint off into the distance to the cargo’s intended destination. If
        that still sounds like too much hard work, it can even carry your Norman
        Reedus-shaped sack of bones all the way to the nearest distribution
        center on autopilot, which is huge news for anyone who’s ever wondered
        what it must feel like to be a bored house cat riding a Roomba.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Meanwhile the cargo catapults, which you can start constructing around
        the story’s midpoint, allow you to load up your boxes and fire them
        hundreds of metres across the map, a bit like using one of the Angry
        Birds as a carrier pigeon. There is a limitation to how far you can
        launch your flying freight before a parachute must be triggered in order
        to manually guide it safely to the ground, but it’s at least far enough
        to clear some of the nastier crevasses or wider rivers in Hideo Kojima’s
        stunning (albeit oddly Icelandic) vision of post-apocalyptic America.
        <br /><br />
        If, during my darkest hours with the original game – such as the
        extended slog through the mountains roughly 20 hours through the story –
        you’d offered me a cannon to fire crates of medical supplies even
        halfway to their summit destination I’d have loaded that cannon with
        hundred dollar bills and fired it directly into your beautiful face.
        However, while the cargo catapult and buddy bot certainly make
        completing orders less painful in Death Stranding, they don’t
        necessarily make them actually fun. At the end of the day, you’re still
        moving stacks of indistinguishable boxes from A to B, over and over
        again. Just because a menial task is made to be easier, doesn’t make it
        any less dull or repetitive; the calculator app on my phone may well
        prevent me from having to count on my fingers, but it certainly doesn’t
        mean I gain any more excitement out of doing my taxes.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In fact, although I certainly had my frustrations with the original
        “cut” of Death Stranding, never once did I think its demanding delivery
        gameplay was in any way arduous by accident. Kojima is undoubtedly one
        of the boldest game designers of all time, and he appears to be
        surrounded by an extremely talented team at Kojima Productions. Death
        Stranding isn’t a great game idea that was executed poorly; in my mind,
        it’s a fundamentally unappealing idea for a game executed extremely
        well.
        <br /><br />
        That makes it especially odd that some of these Director’s Cut additions
        seem to actively undermine what I interpret to be the whole meaning
        behind the gameplay. Unless I’m mistaken, the rewards in Death Stranding
        are intended to be earned by carefully managing cargo and plotting
        intelligent routes to your destination in order to make a successful
        delivery. The buddy bot takes that stiff challenge, loads it onto its
        cargo tray and literally walks it all the way back, taking any potential
        sense of satisfaction with it. Sure, there is a slight penalty for
        relying on your doting droid to do it all for you – buddy bot deliveries
        are capped at A ratings, meaning you derive slightly less likes than you
        would completing a delivery unassisted and attaining an S rank. And
        they’re also not entirely infallible, since occasionally they can get
        stuck on the steeper sections of terrain. But these are both minor
        inconveniences to suffer in return for such a sizable reduction in
        labour.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, there are a handful of features presumably intended to entice
        die-hard Death Stranding fans – or Die-Hardfans as Kojima prefers to
        call them (probably) – but like the contents of Sam’s backpack after
        he’s taken his umpteenth tumble down a modest incline, these are a bit
        of a mixed bag. At the very least, you can gain quick access to most of
        the new features without having to start the whole campaign over; as
        long as you still have access to your completed PS4 save you can import
        it into the PS5 version with all your progress and various shared
        structures intact.
        <br /><br />
        I made a beeline for the new race track, which can be constructed by
        delivering the requisite materials to a dedicated site just south of the
        Timefall farm. Sadly, it turned out to be barely worth the effort: the
        racing track features just two unremarkable circuits that can only be
        raced in simple solo time trials (with the added option of racing them
        both in reverse). Ironically, for a game otherwise preoccupied with
        weight management and inertia, the three vehicles on offer here exhibit
        a noticeable lack of heft. The truck and trike are both slow and far too
        easy to steer around full laps without requiring any real need for
        braking. Meanwhile, the sleek new roadster vehicle is at least fast
        enough to be thrown sideways around a sharp corner, but the way you’re
        brought to an instant halt by an invisible force field should you even
        touch the trackside rumble strip kind of sucks the fun out of it. It’s
        no wonder that Monster Energy has seemingly pulled its products out of
        the Director’s Cut, since Death Stranding’s bland brand of circuit
        racing is about as far away from extreme sports as you can get.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        On the plus side, completing the race track’s time trials gives you the
        ability to fabricate the roadster for general use in the world. It’s
        only really practical to take it out on one of the player-paved highway
        stretches, though, since attempting to steer the sports car’s low
        suspension over Death Stranding’s otherwise jagged terrain feels about
        as smooth as trying to iron the creases out of a shirt made of
        rhinestones.
        <br /><br />
        As far as new story content, I can’t say that the over-explained nature
        of the ending left me begging for more details, but this Director’s Cut
        gave them to me anyway, although only in a very modest serving. The new
        ruined factory is situated to the northeast of the Distribution Center
        West of Capital Knot City. (Giving directions in Death Stranding sure is
        confusing – no wonder these people never leave their bunkers.) It’s a
        dilapidated facility recessed into the side of a mountain that provides
        an interesting space to explore, but there’s just not enough of it to
        really leave a mark. It’s effectively comprised of two main areas that
        each house a small gaggle of guards to take out, a token Metal Gear
        Solid reference, and then a short sequence that gives some fresh insight
        into the backstory of one of Sam’s closest allies. If you’re fascinated
        by the end of the world lore that Kojima Productions has created then
        you’ll likely lap this up, but just don’t go in expecting an enormous
        amount of new information to uncover.
        <br /><br />
        Elsewhere there are ramps to build if you fancy going from Postman Pat
        to Evil Knieval. There’s a new maser gun that fires out electricity,
        allowing you to wrangle MULEs into submission like a Ghostbusters’
        proton pack. There’s the option to replay boss fights and compare your
        scores with other players. You can even customise BB’s pod with a number
        of cosmetic options including ‘wood grain’ and ‘leather’, although
        unfortunately none of the options is ‘soundproof’. There are quite a lot
        of other small additions that make up a fairly long list of new
        features, but none of them make as considerable difference to the
        gameplay as the buddy bot.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A long list of quality of life improvements certainly makes the PS5
        Director’s Cut the most feature-rich and accessible version of Death
        Stranding. If you’re yet to experience its gorgeous vistas and general
        sci-fi weirdness and you’re not turned off at the thought of a 40-hour
        fetch quest, then this is the best way to enjoy its fiction with the
        least amount of friction. However, by giving us powerful new
        cargo-moving tools that allow us to forgo heavily burdened hikes in
        favour of walking the path of least resistance, it diminishes
        frustration at the cost of any sense of hard-earned gratification. This
        may be called a “Director’s Cut,” but I can’t help but feel that, for
        better or worse, the PS4 original perhaps more closely resembles the
        director’s vision.
