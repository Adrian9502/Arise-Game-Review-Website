      <p>
        At this point, it’s probably fair to say that Team Ninja has a pretty
        good handle on this whole soulslike genre thing. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty
        may not reach the same heights as Nioh 2 did back in 2020, but it
        certainly scratches that same itch of lightning-fast combat,
        punishing-yet-rewarding difficulty, and deep build customization options
        that you can craft and tailor to your own playstyle. It’s great for the
        same reasons that the Nioh games are, and it accomplishes that feat even
        while completely changing up the fundamentals of its combat system to be
        closer to Sekiro than Dark Souls. But by that same token, it also falls
        victim to the same familiar issues nagging at those other Team Ninja
        soulslikes, including subpar storytelling and excessively fiddly loot
        mechanics. But when you consider that the things Wo Long does better
        than just about any other game in this genre, that baggage amounts to
        scratches on an otherwise pristine set of armor.
        <br /><br />
        If you’re familiar with the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history you
        may get more out of Wo Long’s story than I did (my knowledge basically
        begins and ends with the fact that you should not pursue Lu Bu), but I
        think even then it won’t be a highlight because Team Ninja continues to
        struggle with telling a memorable story with likable characters. This is
        a supernatural take on the final days of the Han Dynasty, where we take
        control of a nameless warrior who gets swept up in a power struggle
        between warring kingdoms and their pursuit of an elixir of immortality.
        In practically every level you team up with some sort of historically
        significant warrior to fight through a level, have a boss battle against
        an evil or corrupted historically significant warrior, and then move on
        to the next one.
        <br /><br />
        Characters are introduced at a rapid-fire pace and leave the scene just
        as quickly, often without making any sort of impact on the overall
        story. Sometimes they return many hours later, but I’d already forgotten
        them because they didn’t do anything meaningful. Fortunately, the actual
        gameplay in between the cutscenes make up the vast majority of what
        we’re here to do, and it’s there that Wo Long shines brightest.
      </p>
      <h2>The Dance of Combat</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Wo Long’s combat is a puzzle that needs to be figured out really quickly
        if you plan on getting past even the first major boss, but once you
        solve it, it’s incredibly satisfying to play around in. Similar to
        Sekiro, it’s a system that relies a lot on carefully timing deflections
        so you can preserve your Spirit meter while also avoiding damage,
        especially when enemies also start mixing in powerful, unblockable
        attacks that have to be parried rather than blocked. Crucially, though,
        you can completely negate damage from regular attacks just by holding
        down the block button, so long as you have enough Spirit built up to
        avoid having your guard broken – if that happens, you’re left helpless.
        You can even hold down the block button while also attempting to
        deflect, making it so that even if you’re too late on the deflection
        timing, you’ll still block the attack.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Once you solve the puzzle of Wo Long's combat, it's incredibly
        satisfying to play around in.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        It’s a good thing that Wo Long has this leniency built in because in
        practically every other regard, it doesn’t pull any punches. Enemies
        will regularly power through your attacks to deal a more powerful blow
        of their own, they have combos that go on for days, and they do a really
        good job at varying the rhythm of their attacks to try and bait you into
        parrying too early. It rewards a careful eye and punishes falling into a
        predictable rhythm. Even with all of that it isn’t nearly as hard as
        Nioh 2, for reasons I’ll get to later, but it still manages to find a
        really satisfying balance of being tough, fair, and absolutely
        exhilarating once you start to pick up on an enemy’s attack patterns and
        find yourself deflecting each hit of an incoming combo.
        <br /><br />
        One clever wrinkle is that your Spirit meter is also a resource that can
        be spent on spells, special martial arts abilities, and Spirit attacks.
        That’s a nice risk-reward mechanic that lets you put yourself in a
        potentially more vulnerable position in order to gain some sort of
        advantage. If you know an enemy has an elemental weakness, for instance,
        you can exploit that by spending Spirit to enchant your weapon with an
        element to stagger and quickly break them. Martial arts abilities are
        unique depending on the weapon you’re wielding, and there are many that
        offer powerful attacks that can either do big single-target damage or
        give you a way to deal with many enemies at once. Finally, Spirit
        attacks are powerful strikes that increase in damage the more Spirit you
        have built up, which give you another reason to hold onto your Spirit
        meter until you need it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        I never felt like I was stuck against a wall with no idea of how to
        overcome a particular challenge.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        If it’s not already clear, there are tons of layers to Wo Long’s combat,
        which greatly enhances the already excellent swordplay by laying out a
        ton of options and ways to vary up my strategy whenever I found myself
        dying repeatedly to a particular boss. If just straight-up attacking
        didn’t work I could focus more on defense and reduce their Spirit by
        deflecting their big attacks; failing that, I could double down on
        rushing them down and trying to break their Spirit with aggressive
        attacks and martial arts abilities. Or, if I could figure out what they
        were weak to, I could try using spells. So while Wo Long is certainly
        tough, I never felt like I was ever stuck against a wall with no idea of
        what else I could try or how to overcome a particular challenge.
      </p>
      <h2>The Loot Problem</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Where Wo Long feels very similar to the previous three Team Ninja
        soulslikes – in a bad way – is in its loot. More specifically, there’s
        an overabundance of it. I became absolutely inundated with garbage gear
        that I had no use for within just a few hours, and it only got worse
        after that. I’m just not the kind of person who really wants to spend 10
        to 15 minutes in a menu trying to decipher whether a -2.6% reduction in
        Martial Arts Spirit is worth sacrificing a +7.2% Genuine Qi Obtention,
        or if I’m willing to sacrifice a few points of attack power for +24
        alliance Spirit defense. Those simply aren’t interesting decisions –
        those are spreadsheet entries and math problems, and it’s made worse by
        not even being able to sort your massive list of weapons by set, or by a
        specific special effect you’re looking for.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Where Wo Long feels very similar to the previous three Team Ninja

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        I’m fully aware that there are people who love these games for this
        level of hyper-specific build optimization, and if that is you, then
        you’ll find a lot to appreciate here. You can salvage junk gear to
        extract their special effects, then slot those special effects into
        weapons that you want to use, and then you can copy the appearance of
        any other weapon or armor so you don’t have to worry about being forced
        to use an ugly weapon or armor set because it has great stats. It’s
        fairly exhaustive in its options, but it’s also not for those of us who
        prefer action to menu screens.
        <br /><br />
        Fortunately, I found that I didn’t have to get too far in the weeds on
        my first playthrough because I was more than powerful enough just by
        engaging with loot on a surface level. For armor, I just picked whatever
        gave me the highest defense number without putting me into the
        heavyweight category, which would limit my mobility. Then I would pick a
        weapon type I liked, swap it with one with a higher gear score whenever
        I came across one; similarly, when I found one that came with a Martial
        Arts ability that I liked, I just upgraded that as high as I could. No
        major tweaking was necessary to keep me from falling behind the power
        curve, leaving the complexity for those who are looking to test their
        mettle in the multiple iterations of New Game+ or PvP invasions.
      </p>
      <h2>Raising Morale</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        One of my favorite new ideas in Wo Long is the addition of Morale Ranks,
        which is basically a separate progression system that starts at zero at
        the beginning of every main mission and goes all the way up to 25. You
        gain morale simply by defeating enemies, but you’ll gain it even faster
        by killing them using Spirit attacks, Martial Arts abilities, or
        critical strikes. You will also lose some morale everytime you die, up
        to a certain point determined by your fortitude level, which you can
        increase by finding various flag poles throughout each mission. Enemies
        have Morale Ranks too, and those with a higher rank than you deal more
        damage. I love this addition because it gives every level a very natural
        ramp-up in difficulty, while adding extra incentive to explore and mop
        up more bad guys.
        <br /><br />
        Each level begins fairly easy: a bunch of low-morale-rank enemies make
        up the majority of foes, with a few high-rank monsters sprinkled in here
        and there to give you an occasional challenging fight. By the time
        you’re near the end of the level though, you’re regularly going up
        against rank 20 enemies and bosses that will be really tough to deal
        with if you haven’t been thorough in clearing out the opposition.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Some of my favorite side missions even have you sparring against your
        allies in challenging boss battles.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Much like Nioh, Wo Long’s campaign is broken up into main missions and
        side missions, with the main missions taking you through humongous
        levels – from castles, to active battlefields, to jails with Dark
        Souls-like poison ponds on the ground floor – and the side missions
        typically having you revisit those settings with some sort of fun twist
        with regard to the objective and enemy placements. Some of my favorite
        side missions even have you sparring against your allies in challenging
        boss battles. One of the really great things that Wo Long does is that
        it allows you to exit out of a mission from a Battle Flag and save your
        progress on that main mission. This is a wonderful safety net, because
        frequently what can happen is you can find yourself underleveled and
        stuck on a main mission; here you’re allowed to back out to the level
        select, complete some side missions to level up or get new gear, maybe
        head to your secret village home base to upgrade that gear, and then
        return right where you left off on that main mission without feeling
        like you’ve lost your hard-fought progress. [Editor's Note: You actually
        can't do this. I tried it while I was reviewing and must have got
        confused by similar looking checkpoints, because it doesn't work for me
        now. It doesn't change my overall score or impressions, but it's a bit
        of a bummer].
        <br /><br />
        The levels themselves won’t win any awards for how they look, but
        they’re very well designed from a gameplay perspective. Branching paths
        that often allow you to find an easier way through a particularly tough
        area and tons of easily missable optional detours leading to bountiful
        rewards keep them from being straightforward paths from point A to point
        B.
        <br /><br />
        Wo Long’s biggest problem – bigger than the loot issues and the poor
        storytelling – is its enemy variety. Even though the combat system is
        excellent and varied, there’s simply not enough different types of
        opponents to fill a game of this size. The ones that are here are
        fantastic and fun to fight, don’t get me wrong, but part of the fun of a
        soulslike is encountering a new threat, learning their attack patterns,
        and finding ways to get through the fight without taking heavy damage.
        In Wo Long, I felt like I figured out everything I needed to know to get
        through every non-boss encounter by hour five of a game that, in total,
        took me about 22 hours to beat. That took out a lot of the tension and
        fear of death that these games thrive on. Without the anxiety that
        something unexpected might be lying in wait around the next corner, Wo
        Long is still a very challenging game, but one that lacks a certain
        sense of adventure.
      </p>
      <h2>Wo Long's biggest problem is its enemy variety.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        It’s also worth mentioning that Wo Long also includes online co-op for
        up to three players, an extensive New Game+ for those who really want to
        min/max their characters to the extreme, and even has PvP invasions
        (which you can opt out of if you’d prefer to deal with relatively easy
        AI invaders). Unfortunately, not enough people were playing ahead of
        launch for me to test the competitive multiplayer features out for this
        review, but cooperative play is super easy to set up and play through,
        just like it has been in prior Team Ninja soulslikes. You can either
        recruit random strangers into your game from within a level when you
        need help, or you can start a level fresh from the beginning with a
        friend.
      </p>

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s combat plays very differently from Team
        Ninja’s own Nioh games – more in the mold of Sekiro than Dark Souls –
        and yet it manages to excel and falter in just about the same areas.
        When it comes to the clashing of melee weapons, Wo Long is among the
        best in the genre, full stop. Its action is fast and thrilling, the
        options for taking down its ferocious enemies are many and immensely
        rewarding to master, and its deflection-heavy combat is one of the most
        satisfying since Sekiro. All of those strengths outweigh an overbearing
        loot system, poor storytelling, and even a disappointing lack of variety
        in enemies. If not for that, Wo Long might’ve been one of Team Ninja’s
        greatest achievements – as it is, it’s simply a great one.
