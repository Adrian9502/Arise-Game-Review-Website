      <p>
        Here we are roughly one year after the release of Left 4 Dead, and its
        sequel is already out. For Valve, Left 4 Dead 2 represents an unusually
        speedy turnaround time considering the delays and release date fuzziness
        generally associated with its games, notably in the years leading up to
        Team Fortress 2 and the still mysterious status of Half-Life 2: Episode
        3. Despite that history and the potential concerns associated with how
        soon this game is showing up after the first, Left 4 Dead 2 is very much
        a complete game, much more so than the original, and is without a doubt
        the better product. If you're still in the mood to group up with friends
        and slay packs of ravenous undead, then it doesn't get any better than
        this. However, if you're tired of Left 4 Dead's gameplay formula, the
        sequel, as good as it is, may not be enough to warrant a purchase. It's
        a game that's more about refinement and augmentation of existing
        features instead of offering something dramatically new.
        <br /><br />
        As a result, after you've played Left 4 Dead 2, it's difficult to go
        back to the original without a mild sense of disappointment. Remember,
        of Left 4 Dead's four original campaigns, only two were set up for
        Versus play right out of the gate. It wasn't until Valve released the
        Survival Pack months later that players got the full Versus experience
        as well as the now-standard timed Survival mode. Left 4 Dead 2 has five
        full and more interesting campaigns, a more fleshed out and distinctive
        setting with some fantastic action set pieces, more personality, more
        modes, and in general gives you more to do. In many ways, I wish this
        would have been the product that was released first since it feels much
        more full-featured than the original, and the fiercely team-oriented
        style of gameplay wouldn't have been as familiar then as it is now.
        <br /><br />
        It's entirely possible you're someone who never played the first and
        have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'll take a step back for a
        moment. It's the zombie apocalypse, and you play as one of four human
        Survivors who attempt to shoot their way through hordes of fast-moving
        "infected" (which I'll refer to as zombies) to get to the end of a map.
        The sequel is set in the American southeast and the new cast of
        characters is more memorable this time around, as they seem more aware
        of their situation, chattering away and commenting on specific parts of
        the environment as they battle through. Ellis' inane stories while
        huddled in safe houses are a particular highlight as he waxes on about
        accident-prone acquaintances while mobs of bloodthirsty zombies converge
        on his position, at which point the others understandably tell him to
        shut his mouth.
        <br /><br />
        That's not what you should be doing while playing, however. More
        effectively than most other titles out there, Left 4 Dead 2 forces you
        to work as a team if you want to win. You need to talk, and you need to
        participate. Every member of your four person squad of Survivors needs
        to be communicating about what they're doing, calling out locations for
        ammunition, weapon, and health pickups, and asking for help when in
        trouble. The catch is that no stage ever plays out the same way, because
        there's an artificial intelligence called the Director governing the
        action. Packs of common zombies can attack at any time, and if what the
        Director throws at you proves too challenging, your path of progression
        through a stage may even get swapped around to make things easier. It
        makes every experience different, and encourages repeat play as it
        adapts to challenge players of any skill level.
        <br /><br />
        Like before, there are multiple difficulty settings, with Normal serving
        as a good entry-level challenge while on Expert only those with the best
        communication, decision-making, and reaction skills will survive. Left 4
        Dead 2's Realism mode makes the challenge even more daunting, removing
        helpful glows around items and weapons amongst other things, meaning
        it's all up to your communication skills to call out ammunition and item
        pickups or to let people know you're in trouble. If you're the type of
        player who generally shies away from a conversation and prefers to
        remain silent, then you're not going to like Left 4 Dead, mostly because
        your team isn't going to do very well if everyone's only interacting on
        a minimal level. Because of how much teamwork is required in Left 4
        Dead, it's also one of the best games out there for triggering an
        emotional response in players, which works both ways. If you manage to
        pull through, you feel a much greater sense of accomplishment, and if
        you're losing, it can be singularly frustrating since your success is
        just as reliant on the behavior of those around you as it is on your own
        personal skill.
        <br /><br />
        Bots are still included, though, so if you do want to run through the
        five campaigns by yourself that's entirely possible, and should a person
        have to drop out midway through a campaign, an artificial intelligence
        will take over so you don't have to all give up. Your
        computer-controlled teammates will work alongside, making accurate
        shots, swapping out weapons, reviving, trading items and healing when
        necessary. It's nowhere close to as entertaining an experience, but it's
        still functional and playable solo. Ideally, like when preparing for a
        dungeon run in an MMO, you'll be able to get a full party together to
        tackle the challenges, and it's an experience that's at its best when in
        a full Versus game.
        <br /><br />
        Versus is also where you'll be challenged the most, as four players will
        be running through as Survivors and four others controlling the powerful
        boss zombie types. These include the Tanks, Boomers, Smokers, and
        Hunters from the first game, in addition to the new Spitters, Jockeys,
        and Chargers. The new boss zombie special powers add layers to the
        gameplay, such as the Spitter's acid pool that can do heavy damage over
        time to anyone who stumbles into it. The Jockey's ability to take over
        control of a Survivor's direction of movement makes for even more
        interesting combination possibilities here, and overall the addition of
        these new boss zombies adds in a welcome amount of depth and, if you're
        playing as Survivors, unpredictability to the play experience. If your
        Infected team is working together you can time Boomer bile attacks with
        Jockey jumps and Spitter attacks so large groups of common zombies are
        attacking while one Survivor stumbles under a Jockey's control and the
        rest are slowly dying in a pool of acid.
        <br /><br />
        These kinds of team tactics are subject to further refinement when you
        take into account the campaign-specific challenges, some of which are
        sure to get your pulse pounding. To be perfectly clear, this is not a
        relaxing game. You're tense and fixated on the screen at all moments,
        and during sequences like the rollercoaster race in the Dark Carnival
        campaign and the storming and flooding of the second half of Hard Rain,
        you'll need to pay even closer attention. The campaigns here include
        exciting crescendo events and defense sequences that any hardcore Left 4
        Dead fan is going to go absolutely nuts over. In that sense, if you're
        still playing Left 4 Dead and are looking for more, then you're going to
        love this product.
        <br /><br />
        It's not just the better campaigns, the more fully-realized and detailed
        environments and the switch from the dark city streets of the first game
        to the bogs, carnival grounds, marshes, and sunlit construction yards
        that contribute to reasons why this is a better game. There's also a
        wealth of little things that make this a sturdier, more complex, and
        more entertaining experience. You'll find scattered around rooms
        incendiary and explosive ammunition pickups for all to enjoy, a wider
        range of rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles to pick
        apart your opposition (though many of the like weapons models behave
        similarly), and perhaps most importantly of all, in Left 4 Dead 2 you
        can take advantage of melee weapons.
        <br /><br />
        These things can absolutely shred the undead, particularly the machete,
        katana, and limited use chainsaw. They replace your pistol when picked
        up, and are not only a source of gruesome comic relief, but are also
        effective at surging through thick clusters of enemies. If your Survivor
        teammates are trying to heal and share adrenaline shots, choose between
        med packs or defibrillator kits, or decide between pipe bombs, Molotov
        cocktails, or the new bile bombs that when shattered are like zombie
        lightning rods, there's no better way to seal off entrance to the area
        than by meeting any approaching foe with a whirring chainsaw. Or if
        you're out of ammunition and see the safe room just ahead, instead of
        simply shoving foes aside, why not smash in their skulls with a few
        broad swipes with an electric guitar? In other words, the melee weapons
        aren't just a bullet point on a marketing sheet, but add a noticeable
        and welcome element to the gameplay. And, for Valve fans, it's yet
        another opporunity to wield a crowbar.
        <br /><br />
        The most powerful addition is the grenade launcher which, while
        effective at blasting apart zombies, is a dangerous weapon to use
        because of its potential for friendly fire. Using the gas cans, propane
        tanks, and other volatile elements strewn about each campaign map is
        probably a little bit safer, and something that's incorporated into the
        new Scavenge game mode. Here, a team of four Survivors battle against a
        team of four Infected, like Survival mode, the arena is limited in
        scope. There's no travel destination, so instead the Survivors try and
        round up gas cans from the surrounding area and dump them into a
        generator to secure them. The Infected try and stop this process, and
        it's a best out of three affair as the teams of four swap sides. Trying
        to stay organized on the Survivor side; deciding which cans to chase,
        tossing them off balconies to waiting teammates, and ensuring you don't
        actually set them on fire in the process is great fun, and because the
        mode tends to end pretty quickly, it's easy to hop in and out of and
        should serve as a nice bite-sized, more accessible adversarial
        experience.
        <br /><br />
        Across all these modes you'll find the gameplay to still be
        electric-quick, as you'll need to swiftly spin and run and swipe while
        zombies charge in at full tilt, or adjust your aim to help a teammate
        who's been snagged by a Jockey before they disappear over a ledge.
        Because of that, this is an experience that feels more at home on the PC
        than on consoles where mouse control easily allows for rapid movements.
        The Xbox 360 version is still functional and satisfying, however, so no
        worries there.
        <br /><br />
        The game also looks better than the first thanks to the daytime setting
        of most areas that lets the light better illuminate the level of detail,
        and also because of the zombies' animations. The droves of undead look
        much more lifelike this time around, sprinting and stumbling with an
        authenticity that might even be scary if you weren't caving in their
        foreheads with frying pans and cricket bats. The way they react to
        gunfire is far more gruesome, and something fans of the ol'
        ultraviolence will definitely appreciate. It's not just decapitations
        and severed limbs this time around – zombies nearly disintegrate as you
        pepper them with bullets. Entrails spill from cavernous abdominal wounds
        and shotgun blasts can pockmark their torsos, revealing ribcages and all
        manner of grisly innards. Yeah, it's gross, but it's also rewarding in a
        gruesome kind of way. The sound design is as strong as ever, which
        should be no surprise coming from Valve, and new music tunes have been
        mixed in with familiar ones to better root the sequel to its setting.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Whether or not Left 4 Dead 2 is for you really depends on your level of
        exposure and affinity for the style of hardcore team-focused gameplay
        Valve is offering here. If you’re still interested in the gameplay, then
        you’re going to enjoy every aspect of the sequel since it’s improved in
        all areas, from available game modes to strength of character and
        personality to replayability and its visual style. After playing, you’ll
        find it impossible to go back to the first game. Though plenty of other
        games offer co-operative gameplay against mobs of computer-controlled
        foes, no other game emphasizes teamwork as strongly as this, and few
        other games are as satisfying when you’re able to pull through
        successfully, particularly when competing in Versus mode against four
        human-controlled boss zombies. If you saw the original and were always
        curious to try it out, then by all means get the sequel. It is, without
        a doubt, the better game. Yet despite all the advancements and
        additions, it’s still very familiar, and something meant to appeal to
        those who are already sold on the concept. If you’re someone never cared
        for the game, Left 4 Dead 2 isn’t going to change your mind. Even so, it
        remains one of the most distinctive co-operative titles out there, and
        allows for some of the most nerve-searing team-based multiplayer gaming
        on the market.
