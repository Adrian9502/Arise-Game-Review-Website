      <p>
        If you’d said a month ago that PUBG Mobile would run better than PUBG on
        Xbox, and that it’d be free, you’d have gotten a lot of strange looks.
        Yet here we are, and mobile gaming’s future has never looked brighter.
        It’s absolutely remarkable that it runs so well and manages to fit all
        of PUBG’s features onto tiny touch-screen displays.
        <br /><br />
        Make no mistake: this is the real PUBG experience. One hundred people
        hunched over their Android or iOS phones and tablets fly over a deserted
        island and skydive down from a plane to loot abandoned buildings, gather
        up resources, and duke it out until there’s only one person left
        standing. The first time you drop onto a map and see all of the island
        of Erangel sprawled out before you in real-time, on your phone, is a
        surreal experience.
        <br /><br />
        While the mobile version only has the original map available, it’s
        otherwise about as close to the PC iteration as could be hoped for in
        terms of performance. In fact, it’s somehow significantly better than
        the Xbox version from a technical standpoint. Textures are nicer, the
        framerate is more stable, and it hasn’t crashed. While it may not have
        crossplay support with PC and console (like Fortnite Battle Royale
        Mobile), that just means that there’s no danger of opting into a
        lopsided match against people playing with more accurate controls.
        However, it would have been nice to at least carry over account
        customization items at least.
      </p>
      <h2>Overall it feels a bit better than other mobile shooters.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        But of course, this is a multiplayer shooter, and this kind of game
        doesn’t have a great track record with touchscreen controls. Overall it
        feels a bit better than other mobile shooters, but still not that great.
        You can easily move around using the joystick, rotating the camera by
        dragging your right thumb across the screen, and there are on-screen
        buttons for things like opening your backpack, crouching, going prone,
        and even jumping. When a gun’s equipped, buttons pop up for aiming down
        the sights or through the scope, and you can fire with either thumb. But
        doing them all at the same time is pretty cumbersome. After spotting
        someone, you typically have a second or two to line up your shot, which
        is tough, and if you miss you’ll need to swipe your thumb to rotate and
        line up the shot again, making it hard to quickly line up shots.
        <br /><br />
        After playing a few matches I started to get used to the controls, even
        if they’re nowhere near as sharp. But PUBG Mobile isn’t supposed to be
        better than the other versions, it just feels like a nice way to play
        the same game anywhere at any time.
        <br /><br />
        For example, you shoot by tapping on-screen buttons, but those buttons
        just so happen to be in a spot where you’ll often drag your thumb
        across. When that happens you’ll accidentally fire off shots, which not
        only wastes precious bullets but alerts enemies to your position. It’s a
        little cumbersome to loot non-essential items and swap healing items,
        too.
        <br /><br />
        I found that I played PUBG Mobile very differently from how I play on PC
        and console. On the tied-down systems, it’s beneficial to take your time
        slowly moving across the map, hiding behind trees and creeping through
        houses to avoid detection. But on mobile, I busted into areas guns
        blazing with a much greater degree of confidence in my abilities. It
        appears as though the vast majority of players struggle to aim right
        now, though it’s unclear if that’s a general lack of skill or because
        some of them are actually easy-to-kill bots in the lower levels of
        matchmaking.
        <br /><br />
        Developer Tencent took a few liberties to compensate for the controls by
        automating some simple tasks. When you walk over a gun, for instance,
        your character automatically equips, loads, and switches the gun to
        autofire. If you walk over ammo for a gun you have, you’ll pick it up
        right away. The same goes for health items, unequipped attachments, and
        armor. And there’s even a visual indicator on the map and sometimes
        minimap showing which direction shots are coming from, in case you’re
        playing without good headphones. There’s a line on the main map showing
        the plane’s path at the start of matches, too.
        <br /><br />
        Since this is a mobile game, I initially went into it expecting some
        minor pay-to-win elements or gratuitous ad placement that would be hard
        to look past. But even almost a week after launch, you can’t buy any
        items that give you an advantage and I don’t recall seeing many ads at
        all.
        <br /><br />
        The mobile version has a few more progression mechanics in place that
        bring it up to speed with most other mobile games, such as refreshing
        Seasons to work toward timed rewards, you get daily login bonuses, there
        are objective-based event rewards, and you can connect your profile to
        Facebook to find friends quickly.
        <br /><br />
        More than anything else, the portability and accessibility of PUBG
        Mobile more than make up for its limitations. Being able to pull your
        phone out of your pocket and drop into the tense battle at any time is a
        remarkable technical achievement.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        PUBG Mobile is a remarkable technical achievement and deserves
        commendation for being a fully playable, feature-packed, and stable
        iteration of a demanding PC and console game. Touchscreen controls can
        be finicky and it will never be as accurate as playing with a mouse or
        gamepad on a PC or console, but the portability and accessibility of
        PUBG Mobile more than make up for it.
