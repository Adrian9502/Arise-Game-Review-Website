      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        Is Overwatch 2 truly a sequel? It’s a question that has lingered around
        the second iteration of Blizzard’s multiplayer shooter ever since its
        unveiling in 2019, and one that intensified when it was revealed that it
        will fully replace the existing Overwatch, not exist alongside it. Well,
        now it’s finally in our hands, and I can say that while it’s less of a
        reinvention and more of an evolution of the intense, nuanced, and
        brilliantly colourful team-based battle that made its predecessor so
        enjoyable, it still brings enough new things to the table that it feels
        like its own distinct game and not simply Overwatch 1.5.
        <br /><br />
        The bigger question, as Overwatch 2 begins to open up to the public as a
        free-to-play game, is how many of those new ideas are positive changes –
        different is, after all, not synonymous with better, and there are
        definite improvements here, just not universally so. I don’t mean to
        sound too negative – the original Overwatch is genuinely among the most
        fun I’ve ever had with a video game (and one of only two 10s I’ve ever
        given at IGN), so a step down from that is still something very
        enjoyable. Blizzard has simply set an incredibly high bar for itself
        here.
        <br /><br />
        Because it’s not a radical reinvention, Overwatch 2 still revolves
        around the exciting, team-based hero shooter gameplay that made the
        original such a massive hit when it launched in 2016. Its sheer variety
        in character design across its 35 heroes, the ways in which they each
        feel unique to control, and the charm bursting from every seam remain
        clear to see. Everybody’s weapons still feel fantastic to wield, and a
        full pass to the sounds they produce and a slight visual glow-up only
        add to the empowering joy of battle. Its highs and lows, from the
        delight of those last-second tactical switch-ups to the agony of a
        teammate refusing to step onto the objective at a crucial moment, have
        yet to be fully replicated by any game since. That rush was the beating
        heart of Overwatch, but one that unfortunately diminished as it
        descended into a relatively stale affair near the end of its lifespan
        thanks to a lack of new content and an abundance of shields leading to a
        tedious meta taking hold. Some of the changes being made in this sequel
        act as a defibrillator, though, jolting new life into Blizzard’s hero
        shooter.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of the fact that Overwatch 2 is a free-to-play game, by far the
        biggest shake-up that comes with the sequel is the move from its
        traditional 6v6 matches to a smaller 5v5 format. It’s just two fewer
        players in the arena, but it represents a huge ideological shift in
        which tangible repercussions are immediately felt. Aside from the
        potential horror of discovering you were the sixth-best Overwatch player
        out of your friends and finding yourself the odd person out, it comes
        with both blessings and curses – it fully drags Overwatch 2 out of the
        stagnant meta swamp its predecessor found itself in over the past couple
        of years, but also denies itself some of the lustre of its satisfying
        team play.
      </p>

        predecessor found itself in.

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Team compositions now consist of two damage, two support, and just one
        tank character. This means only one of the now 10 playable tank heroes
        can be in play at a time, whereas in old-school Overwatch, tank heroes
        were largely divided between main tanks (such as Winston and Reinhardt,
        who control space and serve as barriers between you and your aggressors)
        and off-tanks (such as Zarya and Roadhog, whose job is to be more
        aggressive and disrupt the other team). That line has become less
        distinct with Overwatch 2, with all tanks expected to play a more active
        role in the battle.
        <br /><br />
        “More active” sounds good, but the problem created here is you still
        need that defensive anchor when driving home a payload, and so a tank’s
        role is now awkwardly split. When only one is permitted, a certain
        amount of responsibility is placed on that player’s shoulders to both
        spearhead the team and bear the brunt of the damage, despite it also
        being their duty to protect the objective. In my time playing, this led
        to a prevalence of Reinhardt being selected due to him being one of the
        only viable protectors available.
        <br /><br />
        It begs the question of where “off tanks” fit in right now. D.Va is
        undoubtedly one of my favourite heroes to play as, but I feel a certain
        amount of guilt picking her in Overwatch 2 as I fly off in my neon pink
        mech to hunt down a Widowmaker, leaving my support teammates vulnerable
        and without protection as a result. This makes the transition of
        Doomfist from damage to mobile tank even more confusing as there doesn’t
        feel like much of a place for him at all in the rotation as of now.
        Simply put, many of the tanks still feel designed for the Overwatch of
        the past, not the Overwatch of the present.
        <br /><br />
        On one hand, this huge shift in team composition is a thrilling breath
        of fresh air, and – critically – something significant to set Overwatch
        2 apart from its predecessor. It's a true test of skill that promotes
        aggressive play and gives 1v1 fights more significance than before. The
        reduction in stun abilities that halt you in your tracks or interrupt
        powers definitely helps the flow of a match, even if it does mean my
        beloved Cassidy no longer has his trusty flashbang. On the other hand,
        Overwatch 2 appears to be moving away from the tactical teamplay that
        originally made it unique among shooters. It just feels like some of
        that satisfying, team-centric magic has been lost in the process of
        shifting to 5v5. While it does mean that attritional shield battles
        thankfully appear to be a thing of the past, moments like perfectly
        timed ultimate combos – like when a Junkrat RIP-tire works its way
        towards a group of helpless enemies caught in a Graviton Surge – are now
        a rarer sight. Matches often feel much more like sets of deathmatch
        skirmishes rather than longer tactical battles.
        <br /><br />
        Many characters have been successfully reworked to fit into Blizzard’s
        new 5v5 vision. Orisa, one of Overwatch’s sturdiest defensive heroes,
        has undergone the most significant philosophical shift in terms of how
        Overwatch 2 is intended to be played by tank players. Her radical
        transformation from a reliable anchor to a mobile damage-dealer is
        evident just by looking at her new skill set, but it is felt even more
        on the battlefield. The whirling Javelin Spin quickens movement and
        encourages charging toward adversaries to deal the most damage possible
        with a primary fire that has been improved to deal more damage at closer
        range. This is in contrast to how Orisa was traditionally used; in the
        first Overwatch, she sat further back and acted as an anchor point for
        other players to barricade themselves behind and rain fire upon their
        opponents. Nowhere is this change in philosophy more apparent than in
        the removal of her football net-shaped energy shield.
        <br /><br />
        As more and more barrier-wielders were added to original Overwatch over
        time, frustrations with shield-heavy metas rose. I remember too many
        times when I’d settle in for a fun evening, only to be met with Bastion
        and a Torbjorn turret safely hidden beneath what seemed like endless
        layers of shields. These initial adjustments to Overwatch 2 clearly
        address this, and thankfully, those multi-shield days feel a distant
        memory due to the significant reduction in barriers being available to
        deploy.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, outside of reworks, there are new heroes joining the party,
        too – one from each class in fact, which brings the full roster to an
        impressive 35 in total (especially so when you consider the original
        launched with just 21). Sojourn, the newest damage character, is armed
        with a rapid-fire railgun and offers a fresh and viable alternative to
        Soldier 76. She doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but her nimble skid and
        super-jump combo, mixed in with her hard-hitting secondary fire, can be
        deadly. Kiriko is a ninja healer who shares some of her moveset with the
        damage-dealing Genji, but in reality, she plays more like Moira or Mercy
        – dashing in and out of the action to aid teammates and dish the odd
        headshot out with a kunai. She takes a little time to get used to, but
        can be very effective in highly skilled hands.
      </p>
      <h2>My pick of the new additions so far, though, is Junker Queen.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        My pick of the new additions so far, though, is Junker Queen: an
        aggressive tank, her abilities really sing when chained together as you
        swing her axe, throw a boomerang-like knife into someone, and finish
        them off with a shotgun blast. All three of these heroes are as well
        designed as you’d expect of Overwatch 2’s pedigree and are packed full
        of character, from their distinct looks to vibrant voicework.
        <br /><br />
        None of these new additional heroes shake up Overwatch 2 in any
        groundbreaking way – I could easily imagine them fitting into the
        original – but they are all definitely fun to play. In fact, the roster
        does seem fairly well balanced at launch, which is quite an achievement
        when juggling 35 different high-powered characters with half a dozen
        abilities each. Rarely have I seen one hero dominate a whole match, with
        each shining at different moments. Some things are seemingly just
        inescapable, though, with Genji still consistently slashing his way to
        Plays of the Game across my screen six years later.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond the shift to 5v5, a big addition to the sequel is the
        introduction of a brand-new mode: Push. It’s essentially a game of
        tug-of-war, with a Baymax-like robot pushing a barrier through a map on
        behalf of whichever team is closest to him. It’s a bit like Overwatch’s
        signature Escort mode, but here each team is trying to push the robot to
        the other team’s spawn point, rather than one team permanently defending
        and one attacking for the whole match. It does a great job of
        centralising the fight, with both teams focusing on a shared objective,
        and the more I’ve played of it, the more it’s grown on me. As with a
        real-life tug-of-war, Push is largely centred on momentum and thus is
        very hard to wrestle back once things aren’t going in your favour. This
        does mean that on those rare occasions when you do manage to turn the
        tide it feels like a real team achievement, though – a thrill that is so
        synonymous with Overwatch’s other modes. I can see it becoming a real
        hit.
        <br /><br />
        The maps that accompany Push are all well put together, with the
        traditional mix of winding streets and tight choke points that Blizzard
        has always implemented effectively into its arenas. They are all
        lovingly crafted, with art and sound working in harmony to create little
        details that build into charm-filled wholes. In truth – apart from the
        odd exception (Paris, I’m looking at you) – map design has always been
        something that Overwatch has excelled in. The six new additions that
        come with the sequel are no exception, with the Rio de Janeiro-inspired
        Paraíso being my current favourite. Its charming, carnival-themed
        payload that you navigate to Lucio’s club showcases the joy Overwatch
        2’s maps can bring when they fuse both gameplay and character together.
        <br /><br />
        Unlike its heroes, which are all present and accounted for in one form
        or another, not every map has made its way over to the sequel. This is
        down to the removal of the Assault (or Two Control Point) mode. I
        understand they had their issues, but as much as anything I’m sad to see
        the places go, rather than the mode itself, and the fact that these maps
        aren’t even available in quick play is slightly disappointing. Locations
        such as the Temple of Anubis and Volskya Industries hold a lot of
        affectionate memories for many. It’s a shame to think of the balconies
        of Hanamura, where I spent many a high noon, now lost to time.
        <br /><br />
        Also a thing of the past for Overwatch are loot boxes – the
        long-controversial gambling mechanic that has now been replaced by a
        more modern battle pass system (costing 1,000 Overwatch coins, or around
        $10). Each nine-week season will bring with it a new series of tiers to
        make your way through, unlocking a variety of cosmetics, from voice
        lines to sprays, as you collect XP. It’s a model very familiar to battle
        royale shooter fans by now, and one that is undoubtedly fairer to
        players than loot boxes (even if a tiny part of me will miss that small
        serotonin hit of a legendary skin flying out of a plastic crate).
        <br /><br />
        Blizzard has laid out a schedule by which each subsequent season will
        bring a new map, hero, or sometimes both to Overwatch 2 in a cadence not
        too dissimilar from when its predecessor initially launched. Having had
        a sneak peek at what’s come up in the next few themed seasons, there are
        definitely some characters, locations, and even ambitious new modes
        worth looking forward to – with some of the team’s most ambitious ideas
        yet coming to fruition. It genuinely feels like an exciting time to be
        an Overwatch fan again, and for that, I’m more than grateful. Given the
        time to implement all that is scheduled to come to it over the next
        year, I see no reason why Overwatch can’t reach the dizzying heights
        that it once did again, if Blizzard plays its cards right.
        <br /><br />
        I do have some slight worries about upcoming heroes being part of the
        premium battle pass tier and not instantly available to all, though.
        That model pushes that pay-to-win door slightly ajar in the sense that
        if a new hero is introduced who is particularly powerful or crucial to
        the evolving meta, then someone can choose to buy their way up the
        battle pass tiers – something we’ve seen (inadvertently or not) happen
        with Activision and the introduction of Call of Duty weapons to Warzone.
        The fact that each hero won’t be available to use in competitive play
        for the first three weeks of its existence is a fair navigation of this
        issue, however.
        <br /><br />
        On the flip side, it gives the more casual player something to work
        toward and a reason (outside of the consistently fun action) to keep
        playing. This sense of progression is further emphasised for new
        players, as while all of the original Overwatch’s heroes will be free
        for them, it will take around 100 matches in order to gradually unlock
        them all without paying. It’s an approach I don’t think is inherently
        bad, as a roster of this size can be overwhelming to dive straight into
        and any easing of the learning curve is welcome.
        <br /><br />
        Admittedly, my most-anticipated seasonal content is not due until 2023 –
        that’s the story-centric PvE modes. The promise of more Overwatch lore
        is what has had me most excited since the sequel’s reveal, and what
        could truly set it apart from its predecessor. A steady stream of
        story-led missions fleshing out a world that Blizzard so impressively
        built the foundations of years ago is a tantalising prospect, and a far
        cry from scrambling through comic books and animated shorts for scraps
        of background information. It’s a shame that none of it has made it in
        time for launch, but it’s still something I eagerly await nonetheless.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        So if the pertinent question to ask about Overwatch 2 is simply if it’s
        a fun game, then the answer right now is yes. It’s still a fundamentally
        great hero shooter, just one that is perhaps not currently operating at
        the towering height of its powers. Perhaps that greatness will be
        recaptured over time, as the community provides feedback through our
        many victories and defeats to come and Overwatch 2 fulfills the promise
        of its newly rebuilt foundations.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Overwatch 2 breathes new life into what was once the sharpest
        multiplayer shooter around, before it had its edges severely dulled by
        Blizzard’s attention shifting away. The switch to smaller 5v5 matches
        ushers in a new brawler age for Overwatch where individual duels take
        precedence over tactical team play, and crucially, all but a handful of
        shields have been thrown out of the arena. The new heroes and maps hit
        the mark, while Push is one mode that could develop into a fan favourite
        over time. The fundamentals are all set for Overwatch to shine as it
        once did in the multiplayer shooter scene once again, and the future
        definitely looks bright with what is set to come over the following
        months. I can’t review Overwatch 2 on what it could potentially be
        though, and instead can only judge what’s in front of me at launch – and
        that is a very fun team-based FPS, packed full of charm and love for the
        world it takes place in, and one that I can’t wait to lose hundreds more
        hours playing in.
