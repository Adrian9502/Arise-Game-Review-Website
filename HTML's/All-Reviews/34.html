      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        Just before my group of four young astronauts with major, personal
        conflicts of interest blast off to the red planet, I'm assured by our
        team leader that, while some corners had to be cut to get our ship
        spaceworthy, it should do its job just fine. And it does… kind of. Which
        is a great metaphor for Deliver Us Mars as a whole. This platforming,
        puzzle-solving, interplanetary adventure is trying to do too much with
        too little, and it ends up touching down just North of adequate.
        <br /><br />
        The backstory for our plucky, rebellious, sometimes even endearing hero,
        Kathy, is that she was separated from her father Isaac just before he
        boarded a colonization mission bound for Mars. Years later, she's been
        through astronaut school on a climate-ravaged Earth and a mysterious
        transmission from Isaac spurs her and her older sister, Claire, to seek
        seats on the mission to bring the colony ships back. Periodic flashbacks
        do a respectable job of filling in the complicated and painful story of
        their family along the way.
        <br /><br />
        The launch sequence from Cape Canaveral is among the strongest. It has
        you perform various checks and landing procedures that feel authentic
        and tactile before watching through the front window as your ship, the
        Zephyr, leaves Earth's atmosphere with no cuts or loading screens.
        You're not briefed on any of these procedures ahead of time, which led
        to a lot of me swiveling my mouse pointer around frantically trying to
        find the highlighted switch for the internal power interval or whatever,
        but it was neat once I got the hang of it.
        <br /><br />
        Outside these scripted sequences, Deliver Us Mars consists of first- and
        third-person explorations of an orbital facility and the surface of Mars
        itself, featuring some fairly simple puzzle-solving and occasional,
        frustrating platforming. There are several sections where you have to
        bounce wireless power beams around, matching the voltage on doors and
        terminals to get to the next area. They're generally not too difficult,
        but I found some of the trickier ones satisfying to solve.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Exploration features fairly simple puzzle-solving and occasional,
        frustrating platforming.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        What wasn't nearly as satisfying were these obnoxious climbing wall
        segments. You have to click the left and right mouse button at the same
        time to grab onto a wall to begin with, and you have to do so with
        enough room that you don't slide off of the climbing surface. But this
        action is so unresponsive that whether you can get a purchase or not
        feels more random than anything, especially in some cases where you have
        to jump at an angle. Also, one of the moves you need to progress in some
        of the later segments is never explained at all, and I discovered it by
        accident when I was just trying out random buttons in frustration after
        I'd been stuck for several minutes. Pro tip: You can hold S and press
        spacebar to jump to a wall that's behind you.
        <br /><br />
        This lack of direction even extends to some segments of the main story
        where you have several different ways you can go, but aren't told at all
        which is the right one and can end up wandering way off in the wrong
        direction. There is an option under Accessibility to always display
        quest markers, and while I don't necessarily need a big star constantly
        guiding my every step, it could really use some sort of middle ground.
        If you tell me to go to Ark Vita without ever giving me a hint about
        where it is, that seems like you're really leaving me to twist in the
        wind.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The variety of high-fidelity, performance-captured, expressive faces is
        shockingly good.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Larian’s incredible attention to detail also extends to the area design
        and writing. That’s exemplified by the city of Baldur's Gate itself, a
        hub full of life and adventure that came around to awe me anew, even
        though it took me 90 hours to reach the titular setting. Almost every
        citizen you’ll encounter there has something to say about the unfolding
        events, and nosey exploration is consistently rewarded with new lore,
        new loot, and new quests. It's downright astounding how much voice
        acting Larian has crammed into these streets, and how good nearly all of
        it is. There are dozens of random gossipers on street corners who are
        just as enthusiastically and professionally portrayed as the main cast,
        and rarely sound too similar to each other. I assume many of the actors
        involved must be responsible for more than one of these bit parts, but I
        can't tell just by listening like I can in some areas of Skyrim.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Doll-like models can't keep up with otherwise convincing performances.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        At least the characters are endearing. What few of them there are,
        anyway. Neil Newborn (whom you may remember as Resident Evil: Village's
        maniacal Heisenberg) gives a great performance as Isaac, a complex
        character with conflicted motivations. Kathy herself is brought to life
        by Ellise Chappell, who gives a convincing performance with a wide
        emotional range. And the story is respectable, with the mystery of what
        happened to the Martian colonists pulling me forward at each turn.
        <br /><br />
        The character models can't really keep up with it, though. They have a
        very doll-like, uncanny valley look to them – when we get to see their
        faces at all. A lot of backstory is delivered through these pre-recorded
        holograms where hairless, faceless crash test dummies pose in place
        while dialogue plays. It really looks like placeholder art you'd see in
        an unfinished game, and the developers just never had the time or
        resources to replace it. There is also a whole chapter toward the end
        that jumps from one scene to something completely unrelated, giving me
        the sense that they cut a significant amount of plot without doing a
        very good job of stitching it back together.
        <br /><br />
        Performance, especially during cutscenes, is also a major issue. My RTX
        3080-powered system exceeds the recommended specs, but in many
        cinematics I would see my framerate drop below 10 fps, even with DLSS
        on. I had to turn off the per-strand hair rendering altogether because
        it kept glitching out. In regular gameplay, it's usually fine. But this
        is clearly not a very well-optimized project.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        A rousing mystery brought to life by a great voice cast and nuanced
        character writing can't really save Deliver Us Mars from its
        shortcomings. Poor technical performance during cutscenes and backstory
        that is too often delivered by these barely-differentiated mannequins
        make it difficult to get sucked into this extraterrestrial world. Even
        when it’s running smoothly, frustrating climbing and platforming
        mechanics are just a chore to get through so that you can reach the more
        clever puzzles and rewarding exploration that break up the annoyances
        with moments of wonder and satisfaction. But I could never shake the
        feeling that Deliver Us Mars simply bit off more dehydrated astronaut
        food than it could chew.
