      <p>
        As Forza Horizon 5 crosses the finish line, the bar for open-world
        racing has again been raised in so many different ways. A map of Mexico
        that’s bigger, higher, and wildly more varied than any Horizon game yet.
        A fresh change to the way the Horizon Festival itself is gradually
        constructed, which results in more one-off events deliberately designed
        to showcase Horizon 5 at its very best. Improved tools that allow us to
        build completely custom events that can be more or less
        indistinguishable from those crafted by the developers themselves.
        <br /><br />
        An enormous visual upgrade, especially to lighting, tyre smoke, and dust
        effects. Hundreds and hundreds of new custom parts, rims, and
        performance mods, and cars with more character than ever. Drastic sound
        improvements, better handling, more granular preferences and options,
        more online activities. It really is incredible across the board.
        <br /><br />
        To understand just how big Forza Horizon 5 is, we have to briefly look
        back at Forza Horizon 4, which truly ballooned into an absolute colossus
        of a racing game back in 2018. Playground Games had taken the impeccable
        open-world racing of all the Horizon games to date, then stuffed in
        simulated seasons, a shared-world multiplayer overhaul, and a shift in
        how the team told their mini automotive stories. But that was day one;
        Playground then spent another three years cramming in even more things
        to do. The Festival Playlist, where new activities were available every
        week. The Eliminator, Horizon’s very clever and effective take on
        bringing the battle royale format to a racing game. The Super7, where we
        could participate in custom-built racing, driving, and stunt-based
        challenges made by others, plus create and share our own.
      </p>
      <h2>It’s all this and a remarkable amount more.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        What’s impressive is that Forza Horizon 5 isn’t just all this airlifted
        to a different part of the world; it’s that it’s all this and a
        remarkable amount more.
        <br /><br />
        Mexico Pretty
        <br /><br />
        he breadth of Playground’s wonderfully diverse map of Mexico is
        exceptional, and it comes as an extremely exotic and interesting array
        of environments to get lost in after three years in Horizon 4’s
        beautiful but broadly more-uniform Britain. Horizon 5’s tapestry of
        colourful locations and backdrops more closely resembles Horizon 3, but
        it feels noticeably more extensive than even Playground’s remarkable
        2016 riff on Australia.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <h2>
        Mexico feels noticeably more extensive than even Playground’s remarkable
        2016 riff on Australia.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There’s Baja, where the sun-baked tarmac hugs the coast as the parched,
        sandy desert blends into the beach, and deep jungle, where muddy tracks
        criss-cross through ancient temples, abandoned airstrips, and thickets.
        There’s the charmingly colourful city of Guanajuato and its maze-like
        network of cobblestone streets and tunnels, contrasted with a sleepy
        coastal town flanked by the ocean on one side and mangroves on the
        other. There’s rolling green farmland draped in crops and windswept
        grass, and also a picturesque gorge that looks like it’s been plucked
        from a Western movie. There’s the semi-arid desert of the map’s
        interior, filled with towering cacti and stubborn shrubs, and the high
        and rocky volcanic peak of Gran Caldera. There’s even a giant stadium
        for soccer shenanigans.
        <br /><br />
        It’s not exactly a perfect recreation, of course – as with all Horizon
        worlds to date it pays no mind to reality, smooshing together a stylised
        vision of Mexico at its most interesting. The result is a fantastic map
        – and the biggest in the series so far by a striking margin.
        <br /><br />
        That size is best observed from atop the Gran Caldera Volcano. The
        Playground Games team has stressed that it’s the highest point in any
        Horizon game, but you won’t have to take their word for it – just drive
        up there and you’ll see how much it dwarfs both Horizon 3’s Blizzard
        Mountain and Horizon 4’s Fortune Island expansions. The massive
        elevation change not only provides one of the best roads in the series
        to date – a switchback-filled mountain run I expect will become a drift
        mecca for the sideways squad – but it’s a killer display of Horizon 5’s
        immense draw distance. I love games that make me feel small in a vast
        new space, and Horizon 5 does this very effectively.
      </p>
      <h2>It’s a killer display of Horizon 5’s immense draw distance.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The garage is just as grand as the map itself, with well over 500
        vehicles, and it’s a selection that still handily eclipses all Forza
        Horizon’s open-world racing rivals. Granted, there isn’t a huge number
        of cars that are strictly new to the franchise – and those of us who
        stuck around Forza Horizon 4 each week for the last few years collecting
        every new car will have seen the lion’s share of them before – but
        Playground has assuaged that slightly with the addition of a lot of new
        rim options and visual upgrades that may help breathe new life into cars
        you’ve seen a lot of previously. Changes to the livery editor also see
        it support higher resolution designs and graphics... but you still can’t
        place decals on glass, which remains a shame.
        <br /><br />
        Between the cars and the map, however, Forza Horizon 5 is barnstormingly
        gorgeous on both fronts. On Xbox Series X that’s true of both the
        4K/30FPS quality mode and the 4K/60FPS performance mode. I’ve been
        playing mostly on quality mode since the frame rate never, ever wavers
        in either mode – remaining rock solid at all times and in all conditions
        – but know that the visual concessions in performance mode are generally
        so small I need to study freeze frames to spot the difference anyhow.
        It’s tough to pick my favourite visual element of Horizon 5, but think
        it might just be the drastically better smoke and dust effects – and
        especially how light interacts with the particles in the air. It looks
        brilliant.
      </p>
      <h2>Open-World Racing Dream</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Of course, while Forza Horizon 5’s showstopping graphics are sucking
        most of the oxygen out of the room, there have been so many other
        improvements to the Horizon formula here it’s hard to know where to
        begin.
        <br /><br />
        The handling tweaks are deceptively extensive, with more authentic ABS
        braking, a snappier steering sensation, and suspension improvements that
        have resulted in a more convincing feel off-road. The radically revamped
        audio is superb, and the amount of cars that now sound blatantly
        different to each other has exploded. I especially love hearing the
        changes my performance parts are making to my car’s sound in real-time –
        nerdy behaviour which is encouraged by the ability to rev the engine
        during upgrade work.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Even before launch, the new event-building tools are already resulting
        in some outstanding and creative courses, races, and activities being
        shared between early players. With considerably more props and far more
        granular options than Horizon 4’s building tools, I’m expecting some of
        the user-generated content for Horizon 5 is going to be mind-bendingly
        good.
        <br /><br />
        A rethink in how the career mode unfolds has seen Playground add a new
        points system that allows you to take charge of what event hubs and
        special races you want to prioritise unlocking. These points, or
        “Accolades,” are awarded for achieving major and minor feats, and
        essentially function as a dramatically expanded version of the Brick
        Challenges in Forza Horizon 4’s LEGO expansion. What this has allowed
        Playground to do is add a handful of additional curated drives to
        Horizon 5, which it’s dubbed Expeditions. These Expeditions inject a
        little bit of the flavour of the Horizon series’ fabulous but fleeting
        opening drive montages back into the main career, where Playground stage
        manages vehicles, the time-of-day lighting, and the weather for
        memorable journeys that showcase Horizon 5 at its very best. One has you
        racing through trees as lightning strikes the ground ahead, while
        another has you racing up and back down the rumbling volcano as jets of
        steam break through the ground around you.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There’s been some significant multiplayer massaging, too; this time
        Playground has ditched ranked play for something less pressurised and
        that won’t penalise you for other people’s bad racing etiquette. Horizon
        5’s PvP modes have been grouped under a single umbrella and are now
        designed to embrace new players as championships progress, meaning that
        unlike Horizon 4 it seems like we should no longer be marooned in
        dwindling groups of sore losers that haemorrhage players as races don’t
        go their way.
        <br /><br />
        The hourly Forzathon Live events from Horizon 4 have also been brushed
        aside in favour of the newly christened Horizon Arcade. It functions
        similarly to Forzathon Live – they’re still co-op events where everyone
        contributes to a common goal – but there’s a greater variety of events.
        They can be a fun spectacle – particularly when dozens of piñatas are
        raining from the sky – but I do find they can descend into a bit of a
        slog when they go the full 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Then there’s the tiny stuff, which still all adds up. A more intuitive
        car collection display which lets you quickly buy multiple new cars for
        your garage and skip the menu shuffling in the dealership screens. A
        cute activity where you hide cars from your own garage for other players
        to find inside barns you’ve discovered around the map. Hell, there’s
        finally even the ability to toggle between opting for metric
        measurements but retaining horsepower for power measurements. (Kilowatts
        are for vacuum cleaners.)
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto
        geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. It’s also an
        extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from
        Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving
        skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy but always
        earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a romantic ode
        to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas.
        It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s exploding with more races,
        activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of
        the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It
        never locks you into something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards
        you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds
        magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot
        of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at
        the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever
        played.
