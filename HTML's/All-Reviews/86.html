      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        Within the first minutes of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, there’s no
        missing the fact that FromSoftware has built its Shinobi-focused
        adventure from the DNA of the Souls and Bloodborne series. But this new
        mutated strain is as much its own stealth-action experience, one that’s
        more focused, cohesive, and in some ways forgiving, despite retaining
        its predecessors' trademark difficulty. As I rolled credits after 50
        hours of pressurized-blood-geyser executions, fantastical monster
        fights, split-second swordsmanship, and sprawling, secret-filled areas,
        I’m left with a deep appreciation for this amazing journey and the
        skills it demands to master it.
        <br /><br />
        To any Souls veteran, Sekiro’s timing-based lock-on combat of strikes
        and slashes is familiar, as is the way you weave through the same
        excellently designed levels that snake, interconnect, and double back on
        themselves to reveal new shortcuts between little bastions of safety to
        resupply. Functionally equivalent to bonfires from Dark Souls, or
        Lanterns in Bloodborne, the Sculptor’s Idols are where you’ll rest,
        recover your healing draughts, reset slain enemies, access your
        character progression, and of course, teleport between them for a snappy
        fast travel.
        <br /><br />
        While I certainly enjoy punishing games that test me and my skills (and
        have proudly bested everything FromSoftware has thrown at me in this
        genre) there’s a sense of empowerment that comes from Sekiro’s generally
        more forgiving nature. For example, due to the seemingly smaller, more
        linear paths relative to the sprawling hellscapes of other FromSoftware
        games, I never felt like I had to go too far to find the next Idol and
        bank my progress. That regular cadence relieves a lot of the oppressive
        anxiety in wondering if all your work will be taken from you before you
        can make it to the next checkpoint, and once or twice I simply sprinted
        through an area, assuming an Idol was just on the other side. It usually
        was. That relieving sense of safety in Sekiro allowed me to appreciate
        the mechanical complexities of it in a way I couldn’t if I was terrified
        of taking any chances. It’s not something I’d wish for every game of
        this genre to embrace, but it’s refreshing and new.
      </p>
      <h2>
        There’s a sense of empowerment that comes from Sekiro’s generally more
        forgiving nature.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Though many of the mechanics and level design philosophies of this
        mystical take on Japan’s Sengoku period (between 1467 and 1615) are
        nearly identical to the formula laid out previously, Sekiro is
        immediately its own beast when it comes to stealth, combat, and movement
        thanks to a Swiss-army-knife of a prosthetic arm strapped to your
        titular Shinobi character. Its most apparent trick is a built-in
        grappling hook that can send you flying to the rooftops at a whim, which
        sends ripples throughout the gameplay. Where all previous Soulsborne
        characters felt rooted firmly to the ground as they trudged down
        hallways and slowly climbed ladders, Sekiro’s level design has
        permission to be much more vertical. Between jumping and zip-lining
        between anchors, that sense that you’re only ever a dead end away from
        being cornered, overwhelmed, and murdered in some dark alcove is an
        almost non-existent concern. When I got into trouble, there was almost
        always a way out if I thought like a ninja instead of a knight.
        <br /><br />
        And this new mobility reinforces the stealth elements of Sekiro,
        allowing you to get into advantageous positions for silent
        assassinations, quickly escape danger and hide to reset a botched
        encounter, or just explore the varied grounded and mythical
        environments. When I first reached Anor Londo in Dark Souls or Yharnam
        in Bloodborne, the sheer scope of the cities was astounding. When I
        first set foot in the Ashina Castle complex, I was struck with the same
        sense of wonder but also completely blown away when I learned I could
        zip between buildings and rooftops for unprecedented freedom in a
        FromSoftware megacity. Speeding up the process of exploration was a
        thrilling change of pace.
        <br /><br />
        That same feeling extends to sneaking and battling through the
        mist-covered forests of the Ashina Depths, and the sheer frozen cliff
        faces of the Sunken Valley, that make up a small part of the journey
        through Sekiro. With this freedom, complex environments like these take
        on an almost platformer-like carefree fun rather than the familiar sense
        of imposing dread that these places are yet another obstacle in your
        way. Sure, they’re still loaded with things that want to kill you, but
        your liberating movement helps to expose the world as a place that isn’t
        maliciously adding to the pain of getting from one point to the next.
        <br /><br />
        Don’t worry: some of FromSoftware’s worldbuilding staples still make the
        cut in Sekiro: the bottomless pit, the poisonous (dare I say
        Blighttown-like) pools in the depths of the Earth, and the pitch-black
        dungeon in the castle underbelly are all comfort food for the faithful.
        But the moments spent carefully navigating these damnable places are
        balanced by the sun-kissed surface where swinging between trees and
        buildings is revitalizing.
        <br /><br />
        Second Chances
        <br /><br />
        And, as the subtitle “Shadows Die Twice” suggests, that focus on freedom
        extends beyond death. As an undying Shinobi, you’re gifted with the
        ability to resurrect yourself upon death, though this comes with a
        number of considerations that make doing so a decision you have to
        consider carefully each time. The foundation is essentially thus: if you
        die, you just lose half the experience and currency you’ve collected –
        and you no longer have the option to run to your corpse to collect your
        dropped goods. (The only exception to this is a mechanic called Unseen
        Aid, which is essentially divine intervention giving you a penalty-free
        death.)
      </p>
      <h2>
        If you die, you lose half the experience and currency you’ve collected.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This is where things get tricky. Every time you rest at an Idol you’re
        given a single-use resurrection (you can normally have a max of one at a
        time) which you can decide to use once you’ve been struck down – and you
        will be. Sekiro is, after all, a FromSoftware game, and death is part of
        the learning experience. But if you die a second time before reaching
        another Idol there’s a chance your tampering with the divine forces of
        resurrection will cause the cosmic disease called Dragon Rot to affect
        NPCs throughout the world. In the fiction, these characters become
        visibly sick, but the mechanical cost is that your chance to trigger
        Unseen Aid will be reduced, each time degrading from the maximum of 30%
        until you hit the minimum of 5%, mitigating that hail Mary effect on
        death.
        <br /><br />
        It’s an effective reminder that there are still consequences for dying,
        but because there are ways to bank your money and you don’t lose
        experience once you’ve reached certain thresholds that convert
        experience into skill points, the danger is relatively slim. Early on, I
        just accepted that dying meant losing half my unbanked experience and
        currency and so I was never bothered by the penalty. To me, the
        forgiving nature of Sekiro that allows you to usually get out of a bad
        situation meant that if I let myself die, I probably could have avoided
        it, and losing my resources was mostly my fault. And in the event Unseen
        Aid triggered, well, it was just a nice surprise. Since Sekiro is less
        about managing your resources than it is about raw skill with a sword, I
        can appreciate the penalty keeping me honest, while also appreciating
        that I wasn’t truly hamstrung by zigging when I should have zagged.
        <br /><br />
        There are ways to use additional resurrections beyond the first, tied to
        killing enemies or bosses with deathblow attacks and are fairly
        self-explanatory once you get into the swing of things thanks to
        Sekiro’s uncharacteristic penchant for explaining its mechanics in a way
        Dark Souls or Bloodborne never did.
        <br /><br />
        In the end, the real decision-making I would wring my hands over when it
        came to whether or not I should resurrect upon death boiled down to
        whether or not I thought I could finish a fight I’d lost, based on my
        supplies and the state of my opponent. If I’d whittled him down to next
        to nothing, then I’d pop back up to finish the job; but if I’d used most
        of my healing draughts without doing much damage to my killer there’d be
        no reason to rise from defeat. I’d take my death on the chin and try
        again, this time with a little more knowledge of what not to do.
        <br /><br />
        Live by the Sword, Die by the Sword
        <br /><br />
        When you’re not skulking around looking to get the drop on your enemies
        to score easy kills with stylishly gory execution animations that spray
        gushes of blood in every direction like a rotating lawn sprinkler, the
        emphasis of Sekiro’s combat is on skill-based swordsmanship that
        requires a mastery of an excellent new rock-paper-scissors countering
        system. While parries and dodges have always had an organic feel in
        Bloodborne and the Souls series, in Sekiro they’re much more heavily
        emphasized and crucial to finding any measure of success against enemies
        big and small.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Sekiro’s combat is skill-based swordsmanship that requires a mastery of
        an excellent new countering system.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Peppered in with the standard fare of attacks are specific thrusts,
        sweeps, and grapples that are difficult, if not impossible, to simply
        block or dodge. But these, of course, come with the fairness of
        telegraph animations, with a literal big red sign for DANGER appearing
        on screen and giving you a split second to figure out what’s coming and
        how to counter this specific type of attack. Thrust attacks must be
        deflected or redirected, sweep attacks must be jumped over, and grapples
        must be step-dodged. Done properly, it becomes a regularly thrilling
        exchange of clashing blades, precision timing, and tactics that looks as
        great in action as it feels to execute.
        <br /><br />
        There’s a steep curve to mastering it, though, because the timing
        windows between telegraph and delivery are so varied and often so
        narrow. But once I overwrote my reactionary muscle memory of just trying
        to get the hell out of dodge when I saw a big attack coming I found a
        simple beauty in being able to stand toe-to-toe with any enemy. It took
        a while, for sure, to let that sink in. But after I was beaten to death
        dozens of times for instinctually dodging backward when my attack was
        blocked, I finally started to realize that standing your ground and
        living by the sword meant I would die less often (also by the sword).
        And when a 15-foot-tall monstrosity swings 10 times at you in quick
        succession and you’re able to not just block but deflect the flurry of
        attacks, there’s a sense you’re the greatest swordsman that ever lived.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Once I overwrote my muscle memory I found a simple beauty in being able
        to stand toe-to-toe with any enemy.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And in time, this process actually makes Sekiro more forgiving and
        somewhat easier than its predecessors. In part, that’s because as you
        appropriately counter the attacks of towering monsters and impossibly
        lethal assassins they’re almost always left open to attack immediately
        afterward. You’ve got a guaranteed window to punish them if you can pull
        it off, which is reassuring to know when you’ve locked swords with a
        seemingly invincible enemy for the first time.
        <br /><br />
        eating your enemies into submission with raw damage alone isn’t the only
        option, however, because Sekiro introduces variety in ways to take down
        opponents with the idea of posture: composure during a fight that’s
        effectively a second, parallel health bar. As you exchange attacks and
        counters, both you and your opponents will chip away at one another’s
        posture meter. When you do unblocked damage, you degrade their posture.
        When you deflect their attacks, you degrade their posture. And when they
        block your attacks, you’re degrading their posture. This means that
        enemies who constantly block – never allowing you to chip away at their
        health – can still be taken down because when you eventually break their
        posture they’re immediately open to a deathblow.
        <br /><br />
        This system reinforces the idea of standing toe-to-toe being the best
        way to fight because let’s say you deflect an attack, cut them with an
        unblocked quick slash, and then swing another blow toward them that they
        block. Sure, you only did a small amount of damage, but all three
        actions degraded their posture. Keep up that pressure and you’ll find
        your sword in their neck in no time, which means that fights never feel
        like they could drag on forever. One way or another, even a fight
        between perfectly matched adversaries will have a victor.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Sekiro continuously throws a variety of unique and challenging enemies
        at you that reliably ratchet up the pressure and complexity.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Not all enemies need to be bested with martial prowess. Occasionally,
        I’d come across a monster that simply hit too hard, or too wildly, to
        risk attempting deflections with any consistency – as was the case with
        one particularly nasty giant headless ape. In these times, the old
        reliable tactic of sprinting in circles around it until it swung big and
        missed gave me the opportunity to quickly stab it in the back over and
        over and over. Old habits die hard.
        <br /><br />
        Which route you take to get the kill matters less when facing the
        rank-and-file threats – they quickly die in a shower of gore when you
        apply constant attacks – but Sekiro continuously throws a variety of
        unique and challenging enemies at you that reliably ratchet up the
        pressure and complexity. Whether it’s a corrupted monk with a massive
        halberd, a twisted quadrupedal monster with Wolverine claws for hands,
        expert swordsmen, one-armed ninjas, gun-toting hill people, or
        supernatural threats from the other side, taking down each enemy means
        different tactics, and there’s rarely much overlap. Learning their moves
        and abilities becomes a tricky dance of flexibility, and while there are
        less than a dozen Bosses – those with a capital B – the world is
        positively lousy with high-health, highly capable minibosses that serve
        as skill-checks to keep you on your toes and your reflexes sharp.
        <br /><br />
        Tools of the Trade
        <br /><br />
        Relative to its predecessors, Sekiro’s character progression is
        admirably streamlined. There are no attributes or numbers to build up by
        grinding Souls or Blood. You don’t increase your Strength to do more
        damage – there’s no Strength. Instead, your Vitality (health) and Attack
        Power (damage) only increase as you receive and spend key items you earn
        by taking down bosses and difficult enemies (of which there are a finite
        amount, though ways to further inflate toward the end do exist). There
        are no real weapons to find, or armor to acquire. Outside of – outside
        of one or two others that serve a purpose in the story, you’ll use the
        same trusty katana from the start of this 50-hour adventure to the
        finish.

        In this way, you already have the foundation to succeed in Sekiro, which
        places emphasis on getting better with what you can do rather than
        looking for another weapon or piece of armor to complete some gear-check
        gimmicky encounter. What fun and varied functionality new weapons and
        armor would add to the gameplay is mirrored in the inventive prosthetic
        tools, so the experience of finding new mechanical advantages throughout
        the adventure isn’t lost entirely.
        <br /><br />
        Instead of buying attribute points, the experience you earn is cashed
        into Skill Points which you spend on a robust, tiered, multi-page skill
        tree that allows you to unlock passive skills like a more potent stealth
        for easier assassinations. You might buy the ability to recover health
        when performing a deathblow (which is hands-down one of the most
        valuable passive skills I’ve gotten in Sekiro) or increase the max
        number of Spirit Emblems you can hold, which allows you to make more
        frequent use of your prosthetic tools.
        <br /><br />
        For active skills, there are a wealth of combat maneuvers like
        devastating posture-pounding strikes, lightning-fast flurries of
        slashes, secret sword techniques that kill in the blink of an eye, and
        so many more. There are, in fact, a staggering number of abilities,
        skills, and combat techniques to unlock and, incredibly, each one I used
        felt unique and useful, even if only in specific situations.
        <br /><br />
        Similarly, the prosthetic limb can be outfitted with a number of
        different gadgets that must first be found in the world and then
        upgraded with precious materials. These tools really open up your
        options as you go, and like the aforementioned combat skills, many serve
        a distinct purpose. The Firecrackers, for example, can startle beasts,
        which is helpful when you’re attacked by a pack of wolves, face an enemy
        mounted on a horse, or come face to face with a flaming bull on a
        rampage. Alternatively, the Loaded Spear is great for pulling weaker
        enemies toward you to keep them in range, and can also strip
        loose-fitting armor off of foes – though this never really seemed to be
        much of an occurrence. The Flamethrower says what it is and does what it
        says, but it’s more than a straightforward damage-over-time device
        because certain rage-prone foes fear only fire, so blowing a pipe full
        of flames in their face leaves them open to follow up attacks.

      <p>
        Some of these tools seem more universal than others: the always-handy
        Shuriken is essential for consistent long-range damage, and the Mist
        Raven Feather that lets you phase through enemy attacks and reappear
        next to, behind, or above them for some life-saving distance and an
        unprotected vantage point got me out of countless jams. Others, like the
        Loaded Umbrella that blocks incoming projectiles or the Loaded Axe that
        smashes shields to splinters, are supremely useful, vital even, in their
        narrow, intended purpose, and rarely outside of that.
        <br /><br />
        These tools also come with their own excellent upgrade trees that
        require precious resources to build into but produce better and better
        versions of themselves. That Loaded Umbrella is still useful by default,
        but when you upgrade it to negate all damage from apparitions – which
        cause the Terror status that will instantly kill you if you take too
        much – it’s a game-changer. Though expensive, when you finally build
        some of these up to tier two, three, or four tools and combine them with
        unlockable skills, they’re absolutely devastating in a way that’s not
        only flexible but regularly fun in seeing what lethal synergies between
        tools, skills, and abilities you can come up with.

        World at War
        <br /><br />
        While there’s no shortage of rich Japanese atmosphere in the background,
        Sekiro’s story is where I connected with it the least. On the one hand,
        it’s a much more straightforward tale than FromSoftware usually deals
        in, as your undying, one-armed Shinobi dutifully serves, protects, and
        endlessly murders at the behest of your master, a child Divine Heir
        blessed with immortality. On the other, because Sekiro is much more
        linear in its tasks, because the characters actually speak to you in
        coherent sentences and give you direction, and because there are ample
        clues and hints throughout the world that let you draw correct
        conclusions, it’s easy to blow through the journey without ever needing
        to stop and ponder, as I’ve come to expect in a FromSoftware game.
      </p>
      <h2>
        While Sekiro starts out like a work of historical fiction it quickly
        takes a hard turn into the mystical and supernatural.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That’s not something that’s inherently bad – far from it – but I
        realized that through the majority of the time I was playing Sekiro I
        was just doing what other people told me to do. I wasn’t discovering or
        uncovering or deciding what needed to be done, I was given orders and
        I’d follow them to the letter until the next set of orders, and so on,
        as though they’d accompanied each demand with a “Would you kindly?”
        Until I finally got to the point about X way through the campaign where
        I started making key decisions that changed the course of the story and
        determined which of the possible endings I’d see, I was feeling a bit
        powerless over my fate.
        <br /><br />
        And while Sekiro starts out like a work of historical fiction in a
        bloody but atmospheric period of Japanese history, in typical
        FromSoftware fashion it quickly takes a hard turn into the mystical and
        supernatural. Granted, it has to, since resurrection is a core feature
        and all existing scientific data points suggests that 15th-century
        Japanese people couldn’t actually do that, but it’s done so in a way
        that’s both relatively grounded in reality and rooted in actual
        mythology, which I genuinely appreciate. These incredible environments
        ripped straight from myth and legend regularly overshadow the actual
        story in a welcome, compensatory way. Moments of traipsing through
        divine gardens, reliving memories from the past, and tangling with
        fantastical beasts all deliver a unified vision of a world that
        straddles this plane and the next, and I loved it. The vibrant, colorful
        sights and moody, atmospheric sounds create a varied world, set to a
        period-appropriate soundtrack that’s equal parts calming and haunting.
        <br /><br />
        Though Sekiro is overall a less obtuse FromSoftware experience and
        things are more straightforward, the world still retains much of that
        mystery that makes these games so engaging. You’ll find an item with
        seemingly no purpose or hear a rumor of a sword that can open a portal
        to the afterlife, or maybe just see a building on a cliff that doesn’t
        seem reachable. When I solved some of these riddles, I was bound to
        Sekiro in the same excellent way as I was bound to Bloodborne when I
        finally saw the unseeable, or helped Solaire become so grossly
        incandescent in Dark Souls. And perhaps as importantly, the nagging
        clues I’ve uncovered and yet to solve will stoke the fires of my run
        into the New Game+.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Sekiro evolves From Software’s formula into a stylish stealth-action
        adventure that, naturally, emphasizes precision and skill in its combat.
        It walks the line between deliberate and patient stealth and breakneck
        melee combat against threats both earthly and otherworldly. Its
        imaginative and flexible tools support a more focused experience that
        shaves down some of From Software’s overly cryptic sensibilities without
        losing its air of mystery. Sekiro is an amazing new twist on a familiar
        set of ideas that can stand on its own alongside its predecessors.
