        Roblox has been a major hit with children worldwide, even though it is
        an odd-looking and often confusing game. For parents at least.
        <br /><br />
        Like Minecraft before it, its attraction to youngsters is partly because
        mum and dad don’t get it. That makes it all the more exciting but can
        also lead to fears over its safety. After all, much of Roblox is played
        online.
        <br /><br />
        There are many Roblox rumours, fake scare stories, and incorrect advice
        rife on social media and even in newspapers that demonise the game.
        However, children can play it safely and enjoyably with little
        supervision and understanding.
        <br /><br />
        That’s why we’ve put together a quick guide to help you understand what
        makes Roblox so popular and how to ensure your kids don’t get any nasty
        surprises.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Roblox?</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Roblox is an online game creator system where the majority of the
        content is created by “amateur” game creators in Roblox studio. These
        game makers are able to create and publish games to the community using
        simple tools. And that means they can try ideas that wouldn’t get funded
        for a commercial release.
        <br /><br />
        These games can then be played by children worldwide, often online
        together, through a phone or tablet application or a web browser.
        <br /><br />
        Games like Prison Escape, Work in a Pizza Place, Shark Attack or
        Disaster Survival offer a playful way to experience adult-like scenarios
        in quick competitive rounds played socially.
        <br /><br />
        Roblox games reflect the sort of imaginative play you often find in the
        playground. One child has an idea about a game to play, others join him
        or her and the rules slowly change as the group decides how to have fun
        together. Creators can quickly update and adjust their games with Roblox
        studio to match the demands of the huge playing community.
        <br /><br />
        One of the best new additions in Warzone 2.0 is proximity chat, which
        allows anybody who gets close enough to listen in on your voice coms.
        That’s a fun and sneaky experience that you don’t get very often in
        battle royales. I could, for example, hear a team in the building next
        door discussing how they could hear me and my teammate looting, giving
        away their location when they might otherwise have gotten the drop on
        me. Warzone has always had death comms where you’d hear the enemy
        player’s mic just after you’d killed them, which is a fun way to revel
        in their defeat, but proximity chat really changes that in an
        interesting way.
      </p>
      <h2>Roblox age ratings</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Because the content in Roblox is user-generated it doesn’t fall under
        the same rigorous age ratings as content made by commercial companies.
        However, PEGI has altered their rating from PEGI 7 to Parental Guidance
        Recommended because of the amount of user-generated content.
      </p>
      <h2>Roblox in-game purchases</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Although the Roblox is a free game to play, children are incentivised to
        make purchases in the game with real money. Kids can purchase Robux for
        cash which is then spent on equipment and outfits in the games.
        <br /><br />
        Ensure that you are tracking and password-protecting credit cards on
        your systems, so no unanticipated purchases are made. It’s worth talking
        to your child about this commercial aspect of the game before they play.
        <br /><br />
        All the games work fine without additional content, but at the same time
        will signpost players to benefits of spending money. This is how game
        makers make a profit from their creations made on Roblox Studio.
      </p>
      <h2>Roblox parental controls</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There are other parental controls that can be used in the game to ensure
        Roblox is super safe for younger players. It’s worth checking out the
        Roblox website for guidance.
        <br /><br />
        First, it is important that you enter the correct date of birth for your
        child’s account. This will trigger the appropriate safe-chat with a
        higher level of filtering. Additionally, this means you will get a
        separate parent login so you can check up on your child’s interactions.
