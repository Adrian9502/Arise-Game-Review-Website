        Watching 128 players simultaneously running into Battlefield 2042’s
        crowded warzones is a great illustration of why bigger isn’t always
        better. While chaotic gunfights are undoubtedly part of Battlefield’s
        charm, massive lobbies with that many players eventually turned the
        series’ signature modes frustrating instead of fun. Thankfully, its
        tense new Hazard Zone mode provides an interesting strategic
        alternative, and its crazy-customizable Portal tools are an exciting
        glimpse at how its future could thrive with a little help from the
        creativity of the community.
        <br /><br />
        After playing Battlefield 2042 on live servers with the other players
        who have the Gold Edition, Ultimate Edition, or a subscription to EA
        Play Pro, I’m not entirely impressed. As the name implies, this latest
        Battlefield shifts the series into a near future setting full of
        high-tech gadgets and freedom to play Battlefield the way you want. The
        goal was to bring back the feeling of Battlefield being a playground
        again. It also does away with even the meager campaign stories
        Battlefield V had, featuring no single-player options whatsoever. What
        it does have is the infantry and vehicle-based shootouts across those
        huge, beautiful maps Battlefield is generally known for, as well as a
        few fresh ideas of its own – but not all of the innovations it
        introduces are for the better.
        <br /><br />
        For instance, at first glance it appears that Battlefield 2042’s roster
        of 10 playable Specialists are based off of the original four
        Battlefield classes: Assault, Support, Recon, and Engineer. However,
        unlike the previous Battlefield games where classes had very specific
        jobs and skills to define them, 2042’s Specialists’ skills don’t really
        change a team’s dynamic much. For example, I first decided to go with
        Support Specialist Maria Falck to act as the team medic. Her Specialty
        skill arms her with a Syrette Pistol that fires syringes which heal
        allies and herself, but damage enemies. I initially thought Falck would
        basically be the only option for someone who likes to play as a medic,
        but it turns out that anyone can go in as a healer if they equip the
        medical crate gadget, which lets them throw out the typical Battlefield
        area-of-effect healing box. And while Falck’s Specialist trait allows
        her to revive downed teammates to full health, anyone can revive their
        teammates or provide healing.
      </p>
      <h2>
        2042’s Specialists’ skills don’t really change a team’s dynamic much.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Similarly, anyone can now hold a repair tool, so that’s no longer
        specific to Engineers, and any Specialist can even equip any gun. There
        are Specialists who have more unique abilities, like Casper getting an
        OV-P Recon Drone to scout with or Sundance getting a wingsuit instead of
        a parachute to cover more distance while dropping into the map – but
        overall the Specialists’ loadouts don’t feel as distinct as the roles we
        played in previous Battlefield games. I eventually found myself
        primarily picking Webster Mackay, whose Specialty is a grappling hook,
        and equipping the medical crate to get maximum mobility while still
        being able to play support.
        <br /><br />
        Not having the usual class items exclusive to specific Specialists makes
        selecting a class feel less restrictive, but it struck me as odd that
        there also isn’t really any reason for a team to diversify their classes
        anymore when anyone can repair, heal, use anti-aircraft and
        anti-artillery equipment, and deploy ammo crates. Specialists are
        basically just an extra skill that you can pick to augment your
        playstyle further – that’s a fun addition, but it’s also a big shift
        that diminishes the importance of individual classes as a result.
        Everyone is a Jack of all trades, which disappointingly lessens the need
        for coordinated squad building and teamwork.
      </p>
      <h2>Everyone is a Jack of all trades.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There are three game types in 2042, and your leveling is shared across
        the board. The main event, All-Out Warfare, has within it the
        Breakthrough and Conquest modes, which both live up to that label with a
        whopping 64 players on each team. With that many people gunning for each
        other on one battlefield everything feels chaotic, even spread out
        across the impressively huge and detailed maps that have been made to
        better accommodate that player count.
        <br /><br />
        Conquest is the traditional Battlefield mode where you compete to
        capture and hold multiple points at once spread around a massive map,
        only this time the map size and player count is turned up to 11. As much
        as I’ve enjoyed Conquest in past Battlefields and wanted to do the same
        here, this actually my least favorite mode in 2042 – it felt like every
        point I went to take had the entire enemy team defending it because
        there are just so many players, and only a few points that are easily
        reachable. It’s the kind of problem that takes a huge amount of teamwork
        to solve, and with the teams as big as they are that’s very difficult to
        pull off.
        <br /><br />
        At the same time, the maps are big enough that you don’t always run into
        anybody else in the vast spaces between points, and that leads to a
        problem where you’re stuck running for excessive periods if you don’t
        have a vehicle drop-in available or if your team spawns are far from
        another point. It’s a bigger inconvenience than it was in Battlefield 5,
        where I didn’t feel as if I was running forever just to get to another
        point and the matches felt pretty evenly paced without so much dead air.
        In some matches, if you’re not fast enough to select a vehicle at spawn
        (which can easily happen if your load times are a bit too slow), you
        just have to leg it to the fight. It’s a bit amusing to see an entire
        army of around 20 people pitter-pattering to the nearest point that
        feels an eternity away, but probably not in the way it’s intended.
        <br /><br />
        That space issue also impacts the visually stunning weather system
        somewhat, which was supposed to be even bigger and better this time
        around but didn’t seem to come into play very often in practice. More
        than anything I just encountered rainstorms that didn’t have any real
        impact on how I played. I’d occasionally see a tornado in the distance,
        but driving near one made it awkwardly clear how small they actually are
        up close. Also, they don’t really seem to do much to the map other than
        blow through it, which was a little disappointing compared to the
        amazing trailers that made this updated weather seem like it would be
        far more significant in a typical match.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It can be a lot of fun to run through the utter chaos of explosions and
        rampaging vehicles all around you.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The returning Breakthrough mode focuses the action a little bit better
        by putting each team on either attack or defense, but with the catch
        that each zone the attacking team captures can’t be recaptured. That
        means the defending team is pushed back to the next point, becoming
        increasingly desperate to hold onto the last one until the attackers’
        respawn tickets run out. Again, it’s hard to execute any kind of real
        strategy this time around since your team is so big and there’s no clear
        leader – but when all of the action is focused on a single target, it
        can still be a lot of fun to run through the middle of this war with the
        utter chaos of explosions and rampaging vehicles all around you.
        <br /><br />
        However, in my matches so far I’ve definitely noticed a problem with the
        balance favoring attackers. Because defenders can only spawn in the zone
        currently being attacked and can be easily surrounded by the attackers,
        I’ve already seen way too many hectic spawns where my teammates and I
        get obliterated by a tank immediately after coming back onto the map.
        <br /><br />
        Hazard Zone is a brand-new game type that currently ranks as my second
        favorite of Battlefield 2042’s options. It’s basically Dice’s version of
        Escape from Tarkov: 32 players (unless you’re on last-gen consoles, in
        which case it’s 24) group up in teams of four to scour the map for data
        points, taking out both small swarms of AI soldiers and each other as
        they go, before extracting from the map. It’s not quite a battle royale,
        but it’s similar in that if you do get killed you won’t be able to
        respawn unless a teammate is able to secure a respawn uplink to get you
        back. And while the first opportunity to extract is toward the beginning
        of the match, the second has every team fighting over a single escape
        vehicle toward the end.
      </p>
      <h2>Hazard Zone isn't quite a battle royale.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Throughout each match you’ll gather “data” that will increase the amount
        of credits you’ll receive afterwards, but you can also loot Uplinks that
        allow you to call in Rangers (the robot dogs that are totally not
        inspired by Boston Dynamics), a LATV4 Recon Vehicle, and Team Redeploys
        that allow you to bring back any dead teammates all at once. (I greatly
        prefer that to games where I have to revive them one at a time!) If you
        didn’t bring these in your loadout, finding Uplinks can instead be
        lifesavers that create heroic moments – if you’re the last one standing
        on your team, a nearby Team Redeploy will be pinged on the map for you
        to run to and loot for a dramatic save.
        <br /><br />
        What makes Hazard Zone great is its progression: when loading into a
        match for the first time you can pick any Specialist, but your loadout
        of weapons, gadgets, and tactical equipment is limited since you won’t
        have enough credits to get anything other than the freebees. Play a few
        more matches, though, and maybe even successfully extract once or twice,
        and you’ll earn enough credits to buy some sweet items for your next
        drop, such as any weapon of your choice that you can customize with
        attachments and increased data storage in your tactical slot, allowing
        you to carry and extract with more data points. My favorite weapon in
        Hazard Zone is the M5A3 assault rifle with two scope attachment options
        for a 1x close-range option and 2x at slightly greater range.
        <br /><br />
        The clever part about this is that the stakes keep rising higher as you
        go thanks to Extraction Streaks, where if you manage to extract two or
        more times in a row you’ll unlock an extra Tactical Equipment slot for
        the next match. If you lose that streak, however, you revert back to
        only one slot, and having something to lose ratchets up the tension a
        couple of notches when you’re wondering if you can take on that group of
        soldiers up ahead. Each streak is attached to the Specialist you used
        for the previous match as well, so if you switch from one Specialist to
        another you’ll lose that extra Tactical Equipment slot and essentially
        start over. This didn’t seem like a huge problem since the need to
        switch Specialists doesn’t really come up too often in Hazard Zone, but
        establishing the Specialist you want to use throughout the mode early is
        probably best. I found that Casper and his OV-P Recon drone was pretty
        handy to have on your team, especially since he could scope out areas
        with Data points and see how many hostiles are around.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Teamwork is crucial in order to survive long enough to go from one data
        point to another.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Teamwork is crucial in order to survive long enough to go from one data
        point to another, and since there are “only” 32 players in a match it
        felt slightly better paced and deliberate than All-Out Warfare’s chaos.
        I found myself eager to queue in for another match of Hazard Zone even
        if I had been absolutely demolished at the beginning of a previous game
        because I wanted to rack up points to get my best loadout in the next
        round. The feeling of accomplishment when you steal the extraction
        helicopter or plane from enemy teams in the last extraction point is
        exhilarating, and it naturally pushed me to queue in for more matches to
        ride that high.
        <br /><br />
        One thing that bugged me in both All-Out Warfare and Hazard Zone was
        that the time-to-kill feels incredibly inconsistent. I don’t know if
        it’s a bug or what, but no matter what weapon types and attachments I
        use, it often feels like I have to hit an enemy with a few bullets more
        than I should need to down them. That gets frustrating quickly,
        especially when some enemies seem to be able to down me just about
        instantly. By comparison, the custom Portal mode allows you to play with
        the settings of past Battlefield games, and the TTK felt just fine next
        to the likes of Battlefield 3 or Bad Company 2.
        <br /><br />
        In All-Out Warfare, the long TTK didn’t bother me too much since you
        respawn pretty quickly and can get back in the action, but in Hazard
        Zone it felt especially punishing since it’s a squad-based game and you
        stay down until you can be revived. I want the TTK to feel justified and
        even in an FPS, but in 2042 I found myself switching from my assault
        rifle to a marksman rifle or even a sniper rifle just to get those
        faster kills since other weapons can be so unintuitively weak. Unlike
        Apex Legends or Call of Duty: Warzone where you can take on three
        enemies at once and potentially pull off an exciting outplay, it feels
        nearly impossible in Battlefield 2042 – being surrounded by even two
        enemies always felt like a death sentence.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Things went awry a bit more often than I’d expected, even from a newly
        launched game.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Another problem was an ongoing bug where I’d occasionally run over to
        revive a downed teammate only to find that they’d already chosen to die
        and spawn back in, yet their bodies remained on the ground like bait in
        a medic trap. Being downed seems to be buggy in general, because other
        times I’d be waiting for a revive but my teammate wouldn’t be able to
        get a revive icon on me, so I’d just have to accept death and respawn.
        Also, finding out that the Hovercraft can scale entire buildings was a
        not so pleasant surprise since that vehicle can inch its way up places
        it shouldn’t and cause a lot of trouble. There were a handful of other
        bugs too: sometimes being unable to bring up the Uplink screen, getting
        stuck loading until you restart, and some server issues. I’d
        occasionally get hit with lag and desync away from where I was, and I’d
        also get some ping issues where my latency would drop and I wouldn’t be
        able to move very well due to connection stutters. In general, things
        went awry a bit more often than I’d expected, even from a newly launched
        game.
        <br /><br />
        The real treasure of Battlefield 2042 is its Portal mode. More of a
        massive playground than a set mode, it lets anybody create their own
        experiences, game modes, or even just new game rules in general. It lets
        you tailor what kind of Battlefield you want to play, packing loads of
        the series’ long history into one great big developer toolset.
        <br /><br />
        On top of Battlefield 2042’s maps and toys, Portal currently includes
        three full Battlefield games that you can customize: the original
        Battlefield 1942, Battlefield Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3. There
        are maps, weapons, classes, and equipment available from all these.
        There are a few preset, dev team-curated modes that you can jump into,
        including Battlefield 1942 Classic Conquest, Battlefield Bad Company 2
        Classic Rush, and Battlefield 3 Classic Conquest. Playing Battlefield
        Bad Company 2’s Classic Rush mode in a match with 64 players using that
        game’s actual ruleset and maps felt so, so good, and it was a stark
        difference from how I felt about playing All-Out Warfare in Battlefield
        2042’s main game mode list. I’ve only dabbled in 1942’s Classic Conquest
        mode so far, but sniping there is fantastic. Playing these games in
        Portal reminded me of how much fun Battlefield can be, especially with
        the classic modes where classes actually matter to team balance.

      <p>
        But the real fun comes from tweaking things yourself. In Portal, you can
        change anything from if Friendly Fire is on for a team, to how much
        headshot damage multipliers are valued at, to if you take fall damage,
        and more. Basically anything you can think to change in a game, you can.
        Not only does it let you create entirely unique Battlefield experiences
        and game modes, but it also provides a more hands-on understanding of
        what goes into game balancing.
        <br /><br />
        Portal can also be used to make incredibly silly stuff, like one
        dev-created mode I played where you have a single rocket in a launcher
        as your primary and a knife as your secondary; in order to reload you
        have to jump five times. Why? Because it’s goofy madness and there are
        no rules in Portal, that’s why. The tools that Portal gives you can be
        overwhelming to look at because it goes all the way down into the
        skeleton of game development – that’s an incredible level of freedom,
        but it also means it isn’t necessarily the most accessible custom mode
        maker an FPS has ever seen.
        <br /><br />
        The good news is that you don’t need to learn any of it to enjoy the
        smartest and craziest stuff out there, because finding community-created
        modes has been made easy – there is a selection of fun featured custom
        modes from the community on the front page of Portal that will rotate
        over time. One of my favorite featured modes so far is CourageJD’s VIP
        Fiesta mode, where two teams face off against each other to eliminate
        each other’s VIP players. The VIP title swaps around between players on
        each team, and the twist is that every time you respawn you’re given a
        completely different loadout and class character from Battlefield 1942
        vs Battlefield 3. Portal allows for so much fun and creativity that it
        might just be the saving grace of Battlefield 2042.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Battlefield 2042 tries to do a lot, but only some of its experiments are
        worth celebrating. The 128 player matches of its All-Out Warfare modes
        definitely feel like too much for their own good a lot of the time, but
        its more strategic new Hazard Zone mode is incredibly fun. But the fact
        that the most fun I had with 2042 was playing recreations of its
        previous games in Portal is a pretty good indication of how ideas like
        its new Specialist system have missed the mark. For a game claiming to
        be the future of Battlefield, 2042’s impressive Portal options make it
        clear that it doesn’t stack up to the past. Instead, it’s those same
        customization tools that could come to define it in time.
