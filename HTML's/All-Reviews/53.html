      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        I find it amazing how far mobile games have come. In the not too distant
        past, the mobile landscape was filled with the Candy Crush and Temple
        Run type of games. With the newest phones packing in multi-core
        processors, hi-res displays, and decent bandwidth, it's no surprise that
        mobile developers have branched out to more complex games. Chinese
        developer/publisher NetEase is no stranger to the mobile arena. While we
        wait to see how Diablo Immortal turns out, they recently released
        LifeAfter, an MMORPG with survival elements in the West. While many
        titles re-released to new markets struggle with translation, NetEase did
        a stand-up job with the English translation. Did the gameplay survive
        the trip from the East as well, or is this just another "cash grab?" We
        explore that question in our LifeAfter review.
      </p>
      <h2>SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In LifeAfter, the world has been devastated by a virus and, you guessed
        it, zombies roam the land. Don't stop reading just yet though. LifeAfter
        is more than just a knockoff of other mobile survival games floating
        around. Sure, the story is unimaginative - after being rescued and taken
        to Hope 101, you are commissioned with setting up camp in the
        Development Zone. You will start by building what can barely be
        considered a shack. From there, you will gather a few resources to craft
        your basic tools, but you will have to head out into the wilderness to
        gather and scavenge the supplies you need to gain a foothold for your
        new home. LifeAfter offers up both PVE and PVE zones to do your
        gathering, so the choice is yours on whether you want to play nice or
        not (or alone for that matter).
        <br /><br />
        As expected, you will have to deal with the infected during your
        expeditions, but it doesn't stop there. During the day you will rarely
        encounter infected, but you still have to deal with wildlife, weather,
        and starvation, not to mention other players in the PVP zones. At night,
        the infected come out in full force, so you either need to be prepared
        or find a safe haven. In the event you do die, some of your belonging
        will be dropped, though generally, it isn't enough to warrant a trek
        back to your grave unless you just can't bear to lose a few resources.
        There are plenty of NPCs to get quests from while out and about, and
        while some of these advance the story, many are just quick and easy ways
        to get bonus resources. Once you have filled up your backpack you will
        make your way back to an extraction point and head back to your manor.
      </p>
      <h2>CRAFTING ON THE GO</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        For anyone wanting to do a little crafting on their lunch hour,
        LifeAfter will surely fit the bill. Base building is an integral part of
        the game and offers both functional and aesthetic options to improve
        your homestead. You are also able to farm plots of land to supplement
        your gathering efforts. Don't forget to build up your defenses though,
        as there are times where your base will be attacked by the infected.
        Other players will be able to come to aid you in defending your home if
        you need the help, and ultimately everything can be repaired if you are
        unsuccessful in your defense.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond base building, you are also going to be spending a lot of time
        crafting. There are blueprints to be earned, and these can be upgraded
        to produce higher tier equipment as well. There is a layered crafting
        system to deal with, which can be either good or bad depending on your
        personal take. There are quite a few resources to deal with, but there
        is a decent balance between being overly cumbersome and a boring time
        sink.For me, cooking was more fun. While some recipes are pretty
        straight forward (adding four berries to the grill makes a jar of jam),
        you can spend a lot of time mixing different ingredients to create
        different dishes, each with its own effects. So put on your chef hat and
        have some fun!
      </p>
      <h2>GRAPHICS AND UI</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        As I stated in the beginning, increased phone specs have allowed
        developers to up the ante in their mobile offerings, and this is one
        area that NetEase has cleared, if not raised, the bar with LifeAfter.
        Graphically, the game is beautiful. If I didn't know better, I would
        think the game was created for consoles or PC and ported over to mobile.
        The game utilizes the power of newer phones and goes with a realistic
        look over a retro or cartoonish style. For those with older phones,
        there are plenty of options to reduce the graphics and CPU workload to
        ensure a smooth gaming experience. I was able to try the game out on
        some older devices (3 or 4 years old), and even at the lower settings,
        the visuals were still pretty good. On the downside, be prepared to
        watch your battery percentage drop fairly quickly.
        <br /><br />
        NetEase has done a great job with the UI as well. Screen location, size,
        and transparency can be set on each UI element. There are even three
        save slots so you can set your controls to match different tasks such as
        hunting or base building. This is top notch for mobile games, and many
        PC and console devs could learn a thing or two from the UI team that
        worked on LifeAfter.
        <br /><br />
        The only issue I had in this area is inherent in trying to put a game of
        this scope on a mobile device, and that is the screen size. With limited
        screen space, I often found myself hitting buttons on accident. After I
        adjusted the control scheme several times, I was able to minimize this
        thanks to the customization options available. Having a larger screen,
        or even a controller, would make the experience much better.
      </p>
      <h2>Pay to WIN</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This shouldn't be a surprise, but being a mobile free to play game there
        is a cash shop. Along with some cosmetic items, there are plenty of
        items that will give players a leg up on the competition. For those who
        can't stand someone paying to get an edge, this will be a dealbreaker on
        what would otherwise be a great game. If you don't care about other
        people buying P2W items but don't want to deal with constant nagging
        about the cash shop, you will be glad to know that the cash shop isn't
        force-fed to you every step of the way.
      </p>
      <h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        NetEase has been in the mobile market for about as long as the market
        has existed, and that experience shows in LifeAfter. The gameplay is
        strong enough that you could play for an extended period, but can also
        be consumed in 30-60 minute blocks while on the go. When the biggest
        fault to find in a game is being almost too big for the platform it was
        designed for, you know the developers squarely hit the mark.
