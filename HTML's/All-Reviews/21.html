      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        Apex Legends is the only battle royale where I can launch myself up into
        the sky and dodge bullets in the air while throwing a mini black hole at
        an enemy squad as my teammate simultaneously rains a hellfire of mortars
        down upon them. Since its release in 2019, Apex has continued to grow
        and evolve in exciting ways, adding both more content and fresh new
        ideas to a genre that too frequently feels derivative. The fast-paced
        matches never fail to get my heart racing as I jump, slide, and dodge
        bullets while hip-firing a sniper rifle to win a 1v1 duel and revive my
        teammates. Mobility, versatility, and teamwork combine for a thrilling
        and rewarding feeling that I haven’t experienced from any other battle
        royale.
        <br /><br />
        While the structure here is familiar – drop into a large map, pick up
        randomly scattered loot, and fight inside an ever-closing circle to be
        the last team standing – it’s the 16 playable characters (called
        Legends) themselves that keep Apex from feeling like your
        run-of-the-mill battle royale shooter. Where traditionally you start a
        battle royale as a blank slate and have your role defined solely by the
        gear you luck into, here each has their own set of special abilities and
        strengths that you can choose from to fit your personal playstyle. I
        especially love how different Legends can interact and work with each
        other on a three-person team to get more out of those powers than they
        could alone. For example, if someone on your team is playing as Caustic
        or Bangalore and tossing smoke bombs around, choosing Bloodhound for
        their ability to see through the smoke and highlight nearby enemies will
        be a natural fit.
        <br /><br />
        And even though some Legends do feel stronger than others in certain
        situations, I like that who would win in a toe-to-toe shootout isn’t
        always going to be what determines your victory. The abilities can be
        used to amplify your own knowledge of where enemies are with Bloodhound
        or being able to get a height advantage with Horizon. But Apex relies on
        your personal skill more than the specific moves of your Legend,
        particularly when compared to a hero shooter like Overwatch where
        abilities really matter while building a good team composition with
        restrictive roles to be filled.
        <br /><br />
        Each Legend also has a backstory built off of the same world from
        developer Respawn’s Titanfall series. Apex takes place 30 years after
        the events of Titanfall 2 and further expands that already compelling
        universe through a continuous story that progresses with each major
        event. While you may not see much of it in the middle of a match, it’s
        still told well through comics and cinematic shorts that include
        in-world explanations for how the Apex Games you’re fighting in came to
        be, how each of the Legends found their way into them, how they are
        affiliated with each other, and even how they all interact outside of
        the Games. There’s great creativity and lore being explored here, and
        considering the Titanfall games never really got their due it’s exciting
        to see Respawn continue their universe through Apex.
      </p>
      <h2>Skill Or Be Skilled</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        I really appreciate the fact that if you get into a fight with an enemy
        who has a fully kitted-out weapon and you have a gun with no
        attachments, you still have a chance to win the encounter based on skill
        alone. In Ubisoft’s battle royale Hyper Scape, part of the problem with
        the gunplay was the fact that unless you had a level five weapon, you
        couldn’t really put up enough of a fight to come out alive or even truly
        damage your enemy no matter how good your aim was. Fortnite does a
        better job of rewarding skill over gun rarity, but the level of a gun is
        still a significant factor. In contrast, all of Apex’s weapons are
        viable without the best attachments, which makes it really stand out as
        a game of skill.
        <br /><br />
        Apex has a wide arsenal of extremely satisfying futuristic weapons (some
        directly taken from Titanfall) that test your aim more than your luck.
        If you’re into long-range fighting, there’s a varied collection of
        sniper rifles that run the gamut from lighter burst shots to slow but
        heavy-hitting slugs, or if you prefer to get up close you can choose
        from an array of SMGs and shotguns. Every other season a new weapon is
        added, increasing the assortment of guns to choose from. Gun attachments
        allow you to further personalize a weapon to your preference in how it
        handles rather than straightforward damage increases, making how you use
        that weapon more important than what’s bolted onto it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Using your weapon well is more important than what's bolted onto it.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        A battle royale should be about testing your skills of survival, and
        adapting to changes both in and out of a match is a huge part of that.
        Each season update, which changes things up every few months, comes with
        weapon adjustments that keep the gunplay everchanging. For example, in
        Season 6, the SMG R-99 was removed from the ground loot pool and put
        inside special loot packages that randomly drop during matches, while
        the previous drop weapon the Devotion was brought back into the ground
        loot pool. This change was implemented after the Volt, a new energy SMG,
        was introduced for the season, encouraging previous R-99 main users to
        use the Volt in its place. In the currently running Season 8, the
        Mastiff shotgun is the strongest close range weapon that most players
        are using, with a midseason update giving it a slight fire rate nerf in
        an attempt to keep the weapon viable but less dominant. While these
        consistent updates can occasionally be frustrating when it feels like
        I’ve just gotten the hang of the previous season’s strongest weapon
        combinations, I do appreciate that the changes and balance tweaks help
        keep one weapon from being stronger than the rest for too long and
        generally make each gun a good choice in fights.
        <br /><br />
        Apex’s armor system stands apart from other games too, pushing a fairly
        simple concept far forward with the introduction of Evo Shields (a super
        cute name for its evolving shield tiers). With the exception of the Gold
        shield that heals you for double the amount with smaller heal items,
        there are four tiers of shields. Only the first three can be found
        during a match, and after that, you must “level up” your shield to the
        next tier by dealing damage to enemies. What I really like about this
        system is that dealing 100 damage while you have no shield at all will
        even automatically earn you the lowest tier, so if you don’t find
        something right away you’re still encouraged to fight through the
        initial drop.
        <br /><br />
        I love the feeling of earning new armor, encouraging me to push more
        fights earlier so that I can level it up – that’s opposed to armor
        mechanics in other games that can sometimes make taking fights feel like
        a mistake because even if you win you’ll come out weaker than you were
        when you started. You can still armor swap through looting better
        options or taking it off of enemies you’ve killed, but the idea of
        having to work for the best tier makes fights feel more rewarding
        throughout. Also, the sound effect that plays when your armor levels up
        is extremely satisfying.
        <br /><br />
        In my 800 hours of playtime, Apex has never stopped being fun, no matter
        if I’m playing competitively or casually. However, you can’t play a game
        that long without noticing some recurring problems. Annoying audio bugs
        have been prevalent for quite a few seasons, with missing footstep cues
        from enemies being the biggest culprit. Usually, that system works
        beautifully, and I’m able to hear enemies walking across a specific
        platform above or below me – but way too often, my squad has been taken
        by surprise when an enemy team approaches without the usual heads up.
        <br /><br />
        With its Titanfall roots, it makes sense that Apex has the best movement
        in any battle royale I’ve played. While you can’t wall run, the plethora
        of other running, sliding, and climbing mechanics it does have can be
        combined to make moving around the map feel magnificent. The slide move
        in particular is the smoothest I’ve felt in any game (other than
        Titanfall itself), and being able to slide down an entire mountainside
        without losing momentum before jumping at the end to continue running is
        one of the best feelings in all of Apex. Respawn’s FPS movement systems
        are still unmatched.
      </p>
      <h2>Respawn’s FPS movement systems are still unmatched.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        On top of that, Apex’s revolutionary contextual ping system was the
        first of its kind at launch and has only gotten more robust since. It’s
        special because it allows you to quickly communicate with your team in
        detail without having to use voice chat at all, pointing out items,
        threats, and pretty much anything else with little more than a single
        button – with uncanny accuracy, Apex understands what you mean when you
        look at something and push the button, then translates that into spoken
        feedback for your team. And even if you do choose to talk with voice
        chat, the ping system can still help you better describe where an enemy
        is, where you’re watching for trouble, or where you’re about to move to.
        Not only is this a great accessibility feature, but it’s also a clever
        way to improve teamwork when queuing up alone.
      </p>
      <h2>Keeping Things Fresh</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There are currently three maps in Apex that make the rounds each season:
        Kings Canyon, World's Edge, and Olympus. Each map almost encourages a
        specific playstyle due to the landscape and size difference. Kings
        Canyon was the first map that Apex launched with and has had numerous
        location changes over the seasons, but it remains the smallest map out
        of the three. This makes it the worst offender for getting attacked by a
        third party when you’re already fighting an enemy team. The small map
        structure allows for you to hear gunfire from several points of interest
        (POIs) over and makes rotations very quick since those areas are pretty
        close to each other. World’s Edge is Apex’s second and biggest map that
        has the most varied POIs that make it harder to get suprised by a third
        party as frequently as in Kings Canyon, and has more options for
        rotations due to the size of the map. Olympus is the latest map to be
        introduced a few seasons back and is definitely the prettiest map of the
        three – it’s also the only map to have a vehicle. Olympus is a gorgeous
        map with the easiest rotations since there are multiple ways to get from
        one point to another, especially when driving your very own Trident, the
        map’s hover car. Each season, two maps are selected to be kept on one
        hour rotations, which stops any one map from getting stale and keeps
        queuing up repeatedly from feeling overly repetitive.
        <br /><br />
        Alongside its permanent game modes that have teams of two or three, the
        addition of various limited-time modes added to Apex with different
        events have also kept it from feeling stagnant or boring. A particular
        favorite of mine is the recurring seasonal mode called Winter Express in
        which your squad and two other teams have to hold control of a train
        that stops at various stations around the World’s Edge map. In it, each
        Legend has a specific loadout that only that character can use, so you
        have to choose the best character and gun loadout you feel comfortable
        with before diving into a chaotic close-quarters skirmish to hold a
        point. Participating in limited-time events like this is optional for
        those who just want to play a normal battle royale, but I really like
        the fact that Respawn is constantly adding and testing new ideas that
        aren’t quite so focused on the battle royale genre specifically, but
        rather just the multiplayer aspect around it.
        <br /><br />
        Back in Season 2 Apex introduced a ranked game mode, which is a bit of a
        unique idea for the genre. I had my doubts about how well it could work
        since there are so many factors to gauging success in a match beyond the
        single team that manages to win. For example, randomized loot drops
        means even the most skilled players can sometimes just get unlucky,
        which is an exciting part of a given game but makes comparing a ranking
        across them trickier. Additionally, the relatively open World’s Edge
        changes team strategy and allows for more rotations than the more
        frequent, clustered fights on Kings Canyon, while Olympus, operates as a
        hybrid of the two. Ranked play switches between two maps for each half
        of a season, so the competitive meta is always changing.
      </p>
      <h2>Apex's ranked mode has actually become my favorite way to play.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        However, the ranked mode in Apex overcomes these potential pitfalls, and
        has even become my favorite mode to play since it pits you against
        equally skilled players. The rank capping at your skill level works
        surprisingly well; I thought the ranked system would be strange because
        you could just keep racking up ranked points if you hold out to reach
        the top five, slowly but consistently raising your rank even if you
        weren’t taking many firefights head-on. But the skill-based matchmaking
        underneath that ranking makes it so you’re faced against people closest
        to your own skill level, making it feel balanced out so no one is just
        earning points without having the skill to back it up. For a game in a
        genre not known for having ranked play, this system works impressively
        well.
        <br /><br />
        The real problem with ranked play is that Apex’s servers aren’t always
        up for providing a level playing field. Ping within servers can
        fluctuate on a dime, and there have been so many times I’ve directly hit
        an enemy, heard the impact, and seen blood fly out of them… only to
        realize that no damage had actually been dealt. I’ve had matches where
        no one could move without being completely slowed by lag until enough
        teams had been wiped to ease the server load, and others where it was
        impossible to switch weapons or heal because the server was so
        unresponsive. In fact, server desync has progressively gotten worse
        after major updates, and while there are maintenance updates every so
        often that smooth things out for a while, it’s not enough to excuse
        issues like this happening in competitive matches where every move
        matters. Respawn did announce it was monitoring server issue reports,
        but more work needs to be done. It doesn’t happen every day, but it’s at
        least frequent enough that I judge which days I’ll play ranked based on
        how the servers seem to be operating.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Apex Legends has become my go-to game when I want something fun and
        competitive. Being able to squad up with friends and try out different
        combinations of Legend abilities in the hunt for that satisfying
        Champion win screen is the perfect mix of thrilling and approachable.
        The consistent updates keep the gunplay from ever feeling repetitive and
        boring, and no match is ever the same as another, no matter the mode or
        map. The combination of Legend abilities and its large arsenal of
        excellent weapons is always fun to experiment with, especially with a
        squad of friends. And while the occasional audio and server issue can
        make an otherwise smooth slide down a mountainside frustratingly bumpy
        at times, I still find myself easily spending hours queueing up for
        “just one more game.”
