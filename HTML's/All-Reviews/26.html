      <p>
        Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live, Diablo 4 is
        completely awesome to behold even though you know exactly how the song’s
        going to go from the moment you hear the first iconic note. Diablo 4
        doesn’t do much to reinvent ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its
        series helped pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas
        it does introduce have forged this latest model into the best Diablo
        we’ve ever had. The finely-tuned combat, extensive build options across
        each class, stellar graphics, and strong live-service foundation are all
        among the most impressive in the genre, and the endgame activities and
        grind are so well thought out that I struggle to find any fault in them
        – as rare an occurrence as rainfall on Mars. A weak story and some
        irritating bugs do occasionally throw a wet blanket over the fires of
        Hell, but the 80 hours I’ve spent in Sanctuary have still been
        overwhelmingly positive, and even after all that demon slaying and
        obsessing over loot rolls, I’m still very excited to play a whole lot
        more.
        <br /><br />
        Diablo 4 is the latest in a demon-centric series quickly approaching its
        30th birthday, and it largely succeeds at modernizing the depths of Hell
        enough to finally match its more recent ARPG peers. You’re once again
        sent on an endless string of dungeon crawls where mastering your
        hotkey-bound abilities, optimizing your DPS, and improving your
        survivability are generally more important than things like an engaging
        story or explaining the insane diarrhea of flickering lights and
        elemental effects that typically occupy the screen – and practically
        every moment of that is really, really enjoyable whether you’re playing
        alone or with up to three friends. Running dungeons captures that
        familiar but just as compelling loop of killing hordes of enemies,
        completing objectives, and downing bosses, and running sidequests to
        learn more about the world’s lore and characters is usually a very good
        time even while the main plot meanders.
        <br /><br />
        If you were hoping Diablo 4 would shock the ARPG world with massive
        innovations to the genre, however, you’re likely to be disappointed in
        that specific regard. Instead of trying to revolutionize ARPGs in any
        major way, Blizzard mostly seems content to play it safe by making smart
        but unsurprising changes to the formula, with things like more
        customizable skill trees and more diverse playstyles between its iconic
        character classes. This series had a lot of catching up to do in the 11
        years since Diablo 3, and whether it’s borrowing combat inspiration from
        Path of Exile or online elements from Lost Ark, there isn’t really
        anything about what Diablo 4 does so well that is completely
        unprecedented. But while there may not be much in the way of
        game-changing innovations, the good news is that lack of experimentation
        has resulted in a game that’s unbelievably well-designed and succeeds at
        practically everything it tries.
        <br /><br />
        I’m one of those weirdos who actually closely follows the story in
        Diablo, and although Diablo 4’s probably isn’t going to win any awards,
        it is still a massive step in the right direction compared to its
        predecessor. The quest to find and stop Lilith, daughter of one of the
        Prime Evils of Hell, after she unleashes her fury upon Sanctuary serves
        as a fantastic kicking off point that I was still eager to unravel even
        after my eighth playthrough of the first act during the pre-launch beta.
        Gone are the days of WWE-like voice performances and dreadfully cheesy
        dialogue, and the queen of succubi is one of the most complex villains
        the series has ever seen, with motivations that even made me question
        the justness of my own cause.
      </p>
      <h2>Sanctuary is a gorgeous sight to behold, and sounds even better.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        But before you get any real payoff for what’s expertly set up in the
        first act, you’ll spend the vast majority of the next four going on
        tangentially related errands with more filler than a packing peanut
        factory, before finally getting back to the task at hand. The result is
        an interesting but disjointed story with a payoff that doesn’t quite
        stick the landing. The real shame is that anytime Lilith is on-screen or
        closely involved in whatever action is going on, it’s absolutely
        engrossing stuff. But she’s largely hidden behind a curtain waiting for
        the final act for the vast majority of the campaign, and the diversions
        you’re sent on along the way consistently feel like unnecessary detours.
        Combine that with some seriously disappointing boss fights I won’t
        spoil, especially the campaign’s final one, and it’s hard not to feel
        let down by what this could have been.
        <br /><br />
        It does help that Diablo 4 looks and sounds fantastic regardless of
        what’s going on in the story. Between the rare but breathtaking CGI
        cutscenes and the more numerous in-engine cutscenes that happen in
        between major story missions, as well as the detailed, disgustingly
        corrupted environments found in dungeons and out in the world, Sanctuary
        is rarely not a gorgeous sight to behold. It’s no small feat, then, that
        Diablo 4 sounds even better than it looks, with one of the most
        memorable OSTs in recent memory, mostly great voice acting, and lots of
        gross demon roars and shrieks as you lay waste to the minions of Hell.
        <br /><br />
        The ending of the story at least nicely sets up a whole host of
        possibilities for Diablo 4’s live-service future and inevitable story
        expansions, but I find myself excited about the potential of where
        things might go more than I am happy about the base campaign we got
        overall. It’s no wonder that Blizzard allows you to skip the campaign
        entirely for every character you make after the first time you complete
        it – a five-minute recap video would be just as effective as replaying
        the roughly 15-hour story. That might have been more disappointing if
        the brief campaign were meant to be the main course of this meal, but
        thankfully rolling credits in a Diablo game means you’ve only just
        finished the appetizer.
        <br /><br />
        When it comes to the things that really matter in the long run like
        combat, buildcrafting, hunting for gear, and especially the endgame,
        Diablo 4 absolutely knocks it out of the park in practically every way.
        Even if they aren’t perfectly balanced, all five character classes are a
        ton of fun to play as. The rogue darts around to deal extreme damage
        either in melee or from afar with a deadly bow in an exhilarating high
        risk/high reward tradeoff; The sorcerer creates horrifying cocktails of
        destruction, like an absolutely disgusting lightning build I brewed up
        to stun everything around me constantly; The necromancer raises an army
        of the dead, steals life, and manipulates the corpses of fallen enemies
        to carry out their foul desires, for when I’m in the mood to keep my
        distance and let someone else do the hard work for me; When I just want
        to Hulk my way through the depths of Hell, the barbarian is an expert in
        all forms of smashing who can charge forward to destroy everything in
        their path; And the druid uses their Animorph abilities and the power of
        mother nature to wail on all manner of demons, with probably the most
        build diversity of any of the classes.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Buildcrafting for each class feels distinct in some really cool ways.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Part of what helps make each option feel unique are the class mechanics
        that unlock at various points in the campaign. For example, the
        Sorceress gains access to the enchantment system in Act I, which allows
        you to enchant a couple of their spells to augment how they work. I used
        one of my enchantments on my teleport spell to turn the standard dodge
        every class gets into a second teleport cooldown, greatly improving my
        mobility. Each class has their own unique twist, whether it’s augmenting
        your ranks of the dead as a necromancer or bonding with spirit animals
        to gain beastly enhancements as a druid, and that goes a long way to
        making your playthrough and buildcrafting on each character feel
        distinct in some really cool ways.
        <br /><br />
        Gear can also substantially affect the paths you might choose to take a
        character down. For example, after completing a job for a demented tree,
        you could be rewarded with a magical pair of pants that heals you over
        time when standing close to enemies, warranting a shift in your build
        from slaying enemies from afar to something close quarters. Or maybe,
        like me, you’ll get devilishly lucky when you find a weapon that has a
        chance of casting a random lightning spell for free whenever you cast an
        initial one, leading to absolute mayhem when you bring your electrical
        might to bear upon an unsuspecting huddle of bandits.
        <br /><br />
        Trying out new builds and experimenting with powerful new pieces of
        equipment is one of the best parts of Diablo 4, and I spent most of my
        time on my sorcerer, where I continuously discovered new and extremely
        rude ways to be the best glass cannon I could be, like equipping an ice
        shield that froze enemies for the sin of attacking me to remove said
        shield. The variety of systems available to optimize your character are
        so numerous that it can be pretty dizzying at first, even for a Diablo
        veteran like me, but when properly mastered this is easily one of the
        best buildcrafting toolboxes of all time. Whether it’s the dense skill
        trees, the endgame paragon boards and powerful glyphs that can be
        upgraded and socketed into them, the plethora of loot options across
        various world tiers and rarity levels, the gems and vendor upgrades you
        can use to make that equipment even better, or the fact that gear perks
        can be tweaked to optimize them for a certain build, Blizzard seems to
        have thought of just about everything. And all that control meant I
        never came close to feeling like my time wasn’t being respected when a
        loot drop didn’t happen to go my way.
        <br /><br />
        There are just so many ways to interact with your build and make smart
        use of your gear. For example, whenever I outleveled a cool piece of
        gear with an effect I loved, I could extract its key perk and keep it in
        my inventory to be imprinted on a more powerful piece of equipment down
        the road. And thankfully, Blizzard has backed down from its previous
        promises to make skill tree respecs prohibitively expensive. Instead,
        they merely hurt your in-game wallet enough that switching high-level
        characters to a new build is a serious consideration, but not one that’s
        impossible or sends you straight to the poor house. After 80 hours on a
        single character, I was still discovering new ways to tweak and improve
        my build or new equipment perks that opened up exciting possibilities.
        That makes it very difficult to log off even when I found myself playing
        nearly until the sun came up once or twice.
      </p>
      <h2>Running through bone-riddled dungeon halls is a consistent joy.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Running through murky halls with my decked out murder machines feels
        significantly more streamlined since the dungeon tweaking Blizzard
        rolled out in response to feedback from the beta weekends, with far less
        backtracking and wasted time. That keeps things moving along at a great
        pace and makes diving into the bone-riddled halls of an ancient tomb or
        what I can only assume is a demon body parts exhibit a consistent joy.
        No matter what class you’ve chosen, shredding your way through piles of
        wretched reprobates is usually effortless fun that lets you flex your
        unrivaled power, though some of the more difficult activities like
        Nightmare Dungeons are bound to put those skills to the test. There’s
        also a good chance you’ll run into a random event that might have you
        rescuing some poor souls who find themselves lost in a crypt, or get
        attacked by The Butcher, a familiar demon who enjoys meat hooks more
        than I thought possible.
        <br /><br />
        Admittedly, regular minions have very few unique mechanics I could
        discern in the few seconds it took to send them back to Hell with my
        coldest regards. Most just run at you while yelping or hurdle some
        pointy object at you from nearby, which doesn’t make them feel all that
        different to fight even when they are part of some distinct and
        cool-looking enemy faction. But you do get the occasional breath of
        fresh air, like shamans that summon new enemies to the battlefield,
        making their summary executions a high priority, or skeletons that
        slowly shamble toward you with big, beefy shields until you’re able to
        tear through their defenses and finish them off. Dungeon bosses have a
        bit of a similar inconsistency – I can only fight so many big, floating
        demon wizards called “The Curator” or some such nonsense before it all
        just blends together into one big pile of satisfyingly defeated gore.
        But others are much more memorable, like one where a laughing cultist
        repeatedly summoned waves of freaks until he ran out of steam and was
        quickly turned into a bowl of mashed potatoes by me and my friends.
        <br /><br />
        Speaking of friends, Diablo 4 is great for making them, as an online
        connection is required to push back the forces of evil. While this comes
        with the expected but rare hitches like getting disconnected from the
        live servers in the middle of your adventures or having to wait in short
        queues to get play during a particularly busy time, the benefits far
        exceed the drawbacks. There’s a much greater sense of discovery now as
        you encounter other players out in the wild (or murder them in cold
        blood in a PvP zone), and those chance encounters when you’re taking
        down a world boss, for example, can turn into new online friends. It’s
        especially cool that trading and clans seem to have greatly increased in
        prominence compared to previous Diablo games, and there’s a real sense
        of community around taking down endgame group activities together and
        helping one another optimize your builds. That’s the kind of magic you
        can get in an online game and I’m very excited to see what ridiculous
        shenanigans the community gets into.
        <br /><br />
        Optimizing your build and coordinating with your squad means nothing if
        there aren’t endgame activities waiting to be conquered, and Diablo 4
        has quite possibly the best day-one endgame experience I’ve seen. Once
        you’ve beaten the campaign, you’ll be able to run bounties for the Tree
        of Whispers, an evil plant with dismembered heads hanging from it, which
        spawns new activities infinitely in exchange for high-level loot drops.
        Doing so at higher world tiers (essentially harder difficulties) also
        gives you keys to Nightmare Dungeons, which are more challenging
        versions of existing levels that add crazy stuff like an invincible
        crystal that magically chases you around the entire time trying to crush
        you and your dreams while you fight suped-up versions of the dungeon’s
        enemies and bosses.
      </p>
      <h2>PvP is possibly the endgame activity with the longest tail.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        I was around level 43 when I finished the campaign, but at level 50,
        you’ll also be ready to tackle the first Capstone Dungeon – a mostly
        by-the-numbers dungeon that serves as a power and skill check in order
        to unlock the third world tier, and which grants access to a variety of
        new activities and loot drop ranks. Some of those are called Helltide
        Events, a completely awesome type of activity where blood begins raining
        from the skies in certain zones, and uber-deadly enemies swarm
        everywhere. Killing them and collecting nonsensically named Aberrant
        Cinders without dying allows you to open special chests that are
        positively crammed with sacred loot.
        <br /><br />
        But PvP is possibly the endgame activity with the longest tail. You’ll
        find two PvP zones in Sanctuary where you compete to slay NPC enemies to
        collect materials while keeping your head on a swivel to defend against
        rival players who might decide to kill you and take your resources for
        themselves. Running around in these chaotic zones is completely
        nerve-wracking and hilarious, especially since even your own party
        members can betray you by scooping up the valuable materials that are
        not shared between players, leading to rifts in even the strongest
        alliance – you might even be tempted to leave the party to rid yourself
        of that pesky friendly fire protection and lash out at a former ally.
        <br /><br />
        Then at level 70, you get another Capstone Dungeon to unlock the final
        world tier, which gives you access to even better loot, tougher enemies,
        and more XP, and, there’s yet another final endgame dungeon designed for
        level 100 characters after that – the treadmill of things to conquer is
        so well designed I didn’t want to get off even when I felt like I had
        seen 95% of what was on offer. The whole time you work towards the max
        level of 100, you’re earning Paragon points to make your character ever
        more deadly against your increasingly formidable foes, which serve as a
        carrot to keep grinding your way through Tree of Whisper Bounties,
        Helltide Events, and PvP zones. Even after more than 80 hours on my
        primary character I haven’t reached level 100 yet, but there is a cap on
        both leveling and earning additional Paragon points once you do, a smart
        move away from Diablo 3’s philosophy of letting players earn
        nigh-endless stat increases in favor of a system that forces you to make
        meaningful choices with the limited upgrades your Paragon Boards can
        contain. I prefer that approach to the bloated monsters that Diablo 3
        characters were known to become, and the endgame grind to reach that max
        level is practically perfect in terms of variety, replayability,
        buildcrafting, and more.
        <br /><br />
        Even if you somehow run out of things to do in the endgame for one
        character, rolling a second or third character instantly becomes a fresh
        experience since the campaign is optional and many unlocks like Altars
        of Lilith (fonts of power hidden throughout Sanctuary) and potions/skill
        points granted from gaining renown in regions of the map are
        account-wide bonuses that instantly apply to your character. The most
        important of these instant unlocks is your mount, which allows your new
        characters to hop on a horse and race off to faraway parts of the map so
        you can begin leveling by playing whichever activities you want, rather
        than being stuck to the campaign’s railroad tracks every time you want
        to try out a new class. Tackling dungeons or participating in PvP from
        the fresh perspective of a whole new class immediately shakes off any
        dust Diablo 4’s lengthy grind might gather and extends the good times
        even further than I thought possible.
        <br /><br />
        The best part about Diablo 4’s endgame successes, though, is that all of
        it’s built upon a live-service foundation that will allow the world,
        meta, and activities to evolve over time. Whether or not that model will
        be updated with content frequently enough to keep people interested
        remains to be seen, but even without it, the vanilla endgame experience
        is strong enough on its own. I can only imagine how exciting it’ll be
        when new experiences are added to the Diablo 4 playground that challenge
        your maxed out characters in exciting ways and expand upon the story or
        available character classes. Live-service games get a lot of hate
        nowadays, and I understand why when there are so many recent examples of
        how not to do them (I’m looking at you, CrossfireX). But that model can
        also breathe endless life into a game when done right – we don’t know
        yet if Blizzard will do it justice, but right now I couldn’t be happier
        that the groundwork has at least been well laid for Diablo 4 to
        potentially thrive going forward.
        <br /><br />
        Hopefully some of those updates come sooner rather than later, too, as
        Diablo 4 does suffer from a few nasty bugs at the moment. For example,
        if you enjoy teleporting around as a sorcerer, be prepared to get stuck
        in the ground literally hundreds of times, as Blizzard apparently didn’t
        account for vertical geometry changes when zipping around the top-down
        levels. Thankfully the issue can be resolved by just teleporting back to
        town, but it also forced me to retrace my steps to my original location,
        wasting tons of time…only for it to happen again when I teleported a few
        minutes later. There’s also some weird rubberbanding that sometimes goes
        on when you try to go from one region to another that prevents you from
        entering a zone. In some instances, my friends and I had to use one
        another as teleporting waypoints to get into regions we were completely
        unable to enter. Most of Diablo 4’s issues are extremely specific things
        that will likely get patched, but they were bad enough to tangibly
        impact my enjoyment a bit in the meantime.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Diablo 4 is a stunning sequel with near perfect endgame and progression
        design that makes it absolutely excruciating to put down. The story is a
        pretty big disappointment despite still being a noticeable improvement
        over Diablo 3 and there are some annoying bugs that need squashing, but
        the combat, the loot game, and both the sights and sounds of this world
        are impressive enough to smooth over those rough edges. Diablo 4 takes
        the strategy of refining things the series already did so well rather
        than giving it a more substantial overhaul, and that careful and
        reverent path has shaped this massive sequel into one of the most
        polished ARPGs ever created, which makes slicing through the legions of
        the damned a hell of a good time.
