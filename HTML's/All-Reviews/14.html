      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        No other video game has unleashed my creativity like Minecraft. I've
        spent countless hours chipping away at blocks, gathering the necessary
        materials to complete the next masterpiece that would otherwise only
        occupy my mind's eye. I've also spent just as many hours exploring,
        spelunking and slashing my way through monsters with bravado. My
        character – my entire Minecraft world – constantly evolves into whatever
        I want it to be. I tell my own stories, I write my own destiny and I
        bring my fantasies to life one brick at a time.
        <br /><br />
        Minecraft stands out not only for the way it inspires me creatively, but
        also because of its unique aesthetic. Look, I know the visuals look
        dated and a bit silly, but few games have visuals so endearing and
        charming. I know I'm not the only one who feels that way either, or else
        Minecraft's graphics wouldn't be so iconic. Could you take a texture
        from Gears of War, Halo or Uncharted, put it on a shirt and have players
        identify it? I doubt it. The looks just work, giving the game a super
        unique appearance that's memorable, and brings up a bit of nostalgia in
        me for 8-bit era games.
        <br /><br />
        I love creating in Minecraft, but my gratification is due, at least
        partially, to the fact that I have to earn everything. Survival Mode
        generates a random world with nothing to your name, forced to gather
        resources in order to construct food, shelter and tools. By the time I
        crafted and installed a wooden door in my first mud hut I felt a sense
        of ownership . Other games let you buy a home with the money you earn,
        but none of them really challenge you to forage for the materials and
        build it yourself. When I look at my home and see every piece of
        furniture and wall is exactly where I wanted it, I love it all the more
        or change it at my whim. From the moment my home was built, my mission
        was clear: tunnel into the earth in order to get whatever I needed to
        carve out a fortress in my little part of the world.
        <br /><br />
        Creating items in Minecraft is one of the most important actions you do.
        The problem, though, is the necessary information isn't found in
        Minecraft. The first time I beat my way through some trees and gathered
        wood, I had no clue what to do with it. Thankfully, like many Minecraft
        players, I had a mentor who pointed me to the various online forums,
        communities and wikis. I have pages that I return to all the time, often
        tabbing out of the game itself when I can't remember exactly how to
        craft an item. For many this is just a rite of passage, but mostly it's
        an obtuse way to handle crafting. I'd love for the recipes to be
        integrated into the game somehow, even if I had to find them throughout
        the world. There's not much of a sense of accomplishment in reading a
        wiki and just following instructions verbatim.
        <br /><br />
        Even after you find a good resource, it still takes a lot of effort to
        learn everything. The sheer amount of recipes and items you work with in
        the game is intimidating and time consuming to learn. Many games have
        poor documentation, but Minecraft has none at all, and what's available
        isn't easily digestible.
        <br /><br />
        But Minecraft is still more than fun enough to warrant the learning
        curve. The addiction, though, really begins as you craft items and gain
        mastery over your surroundings. Suddenly night time, when monsters spawn
        and take over the unlit portions of the world, isn't as scary. I mean,
        it's always a bit scary, but having a sword in hand – even a simple,
        wood one – instills a sense of power. Like a caveman whittling their
        first spear or stoking their first fire, building simple tools and
        torches in Minecraft makes me feel safer, like I am the master of my
        fate because I have the power to create the items that can save me.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond safety, crafting creates a whole new set of goals in Minecraft. I
        crafted items as needed (tools and torches), but eventually I expanded
        my repertoire to include superfluous pieces. To finish my first stone
        keep I had to craft stairs and ladders; simply jumping up a simple
        series of platforms was unbecoming of the king of the land, after all.
        Crafting slowly became something I did less to survive, and more to
        complete the next big project I set out for myself. Creating panes of
        glass didn't really give me an edge in my world, for instance, but it
        did make the viewport of my scale Star Wars AT-AT look a lot more
        badass. Crafting even gets more complex if you want it to. You can
        create tools and buildings or elaborate self-powered rail systems,
        taking you from the stone age to the 20th century,, and making you feel
        like the fate of my world lies squarely in my hands. It's exhilarating,
        and instills a sense of power that I rarely feel in games.
        <br /><br />
        After I secured a plot of land in my world, my intentions during a
        session with Minecraft changed. Each session became an adventure,
        wherein I challenged myself to go exploring for the next crucial
        component parts needed for the next recipe. These self-imposed quests
        are why I sometimes venture into the Nether, a hellish other world where
        monsters – who just so happen to drop precious materials – live. Other
        times I venture into dark caves, donning crafted armor and enchanted
        weapons so that I can tackle whatever enemies I come across. I don't
        know what exactly I'll find, or what terrors I'll face, but I do it all
        in the name of finding precious blocks – and the thrill of the
        experiencing the unknown.
        <br /><br />
        That thrill, that experience of unplanned and unpredictable adventure,
        makes every session with Minecraft exhilarating. Sometimes I might end
        up spending the evening doing mundane activities like farming or hunting
        for food, but other nights I might end up stumbling upon a gigantic,
        randomly generated mine that's full of monsters and treasure. Because
        each world is procedurally created, I never know just what I'll stumble
        upon next. One day my character may be a simple builder, the next he's a
        dungeon conquering hero who slays horrors in the dark.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, adventuring is always better with friends, and Minecraft's
        multiplayer is great fun if you can get it working. It isn't broken or a
        completely buggy mess, but requires a lot steps to get started compared
        to most games. If you want to start a game you'll need to download
        additional software, and go through all kinds of online tutorials to get
        it working. Players who just want to join a game have to know the
        server's I.P. address, since there is no server browser built into the
        game. Still, annoyances and tedium aside, if you have the option to play
        with others you definitely should; exploring, adventuring and building
        up epic structures is a lot more fun with friends. Besides, if you're
        going to spend hours of your life building gigantic monuments, you might
        as well have someone else to show them to. You can post them in online
        videos, but it just isn't the same as having your friend right next to
        you sharing in your accomplishment. Or, even better, having them log on
        after a period of inactivity to be stunned at the marvels you've built
        in their absence.
        <br /><br />
        If you're not the type to play with others, and you don't want to earn
        all your materials, you can always jump into Creative Mode. In this
        world you're invincible, and have access to every item in the game. It's
        great if you want to, say, create a gigantic Wampa from Star Wars, but
        it doesn't give me the same sense of reward or accomplishment I get when
        playing Survival since I don't have to earn the blocks or fend for my
        life while doing so. Many blocks take considerable effort to acquire
        (some even make you journey into monster filled labyrinths), so when I
        build them in my Survival Mode it's a lot more impressive. Still, it's a
        fun distraction.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Like any review, my feelings on Minecraft are the result of my
        experience with it. Maybe you don’t thrive off random adventures like I
        do, or maybe you won’t feel the same sense of accomplishment I did when
        I completed my first house. If not, then you likely haven’t or won’t
        enjoy Minecraft in the same way. And that’s OK. Minecraft, more than any
        other game I know, isn’t about playing it a specific way; it’s an
        open-world, a blank page just daring you to jump in and do with it what
        you will. The question, then, isn’t what you need to do to succeed,
        what’s needed to win, but what are you willing to do to make your dreams
        come to life?
