      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        The Far Cry series has long experienced something of an identity crisis.
        Is it a hard–boiled story of survival, or a goofy physics playground
        with pet bears and flamethrowers? The answer has usually been “a bit of
        both,” and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Far Cry 6 doesn’t buck
        that trend – the flamethrower definitely hasn’t gone anywhere – but the
        latest installment does manage to smooth over a lot of the bumps that
        have cropped up in the past few games, and in doing so becomes the best
        the series has been in years – but it also misses some steps, especially
        with its updated inventory system, and that creates some new problems
        along the way.
        <br /><br />
        Far Cry 6 once again sees you trapped in a huge open world controlled by
        a charismatic madman, this time on the fictional island nation of Yara.
        Even after this many games, the job of turning all the red dots on your
        map into blue ones is still a good time, whether by sneakily silencing
        every enemy guard or by going the less subtle route of throwing bullets
        and Molotovs at them until no one is left.
        <br /><br />
        Primarily modeled after Cuba, Yara is ruled by fascistic dictator Anton
        Castillo, who’s expertly portrayed by notorious TV bad guy Giancarlo
        Esposito; with this performance, he has handily claimed the top spot on
        my list of favorite Far Cry villains (with apologies to Mr. Mando). His
        regime would be too preposterously evil to believe at times, if not for
        its real-world South and Central American inspirations. But it’s his
        unwavering devotion to his vision of a “perfect” Yara, along with
        Esposito’s natural gravitas and the stoic charm he projects to his
        still-loyal subjects, that make him a great foil to the chaotic diaspora
        of revolutionaries you’re working to unite as you attempt to topple the
        regime of El Presidente and his lieutenants.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Castillo's regime would be too preposterously evil to believe at times
        if not for its real-world inspirations.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Castillo’s underlings aren’t necessarily anyone to write home about,
        running the gamut from “psychotic navy Admiral” to “psychotic air force
        Captain” to “psychotic propaganda director.” They’re all played well,
        but even the more interesting inclusions of a North American pharma
        tycoon and Yara’s own friendly neighborhood mad scientist feel like
        familiar entries in the Big Book of Video Game Bad Guys – especially
        when compared to Esposito’s Castillo.
        <br /><br />
        Every one of Esposito’s scenes is captivating, particularly during the
        exchanges with his son, Diego. He’s a boy trying to reconcile his
        understanding that the impact of our actions on others is more important
        than our own intentions with his father’s vehement belief that noble
        ends justify despicable means, which creates some powerful (if
        one-sided) tension throughout. It’s a shame that the very end of the
        story doesn’t provide a clearer resolution for all the plot threads it
        introduces – though Castillo remains a memorable antagonist until the
        bitter end. While a lot of the success of the character belongs to
        Esposito for his work on the role, the cinematic animation team deserves
        a commendation for translating the minute details in his performance
        onto digital character models.
      </p>
      <h2>Every one of Esposito’s scenes is captivating.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The story overall can be a fairly predictable affair, with all of the
        sudden-but-inevitable betrayals and tragic-yet-motivational character
        deaths you’d expect from a big-budget popcorn flick. It does manage to
        balance its more serious main story with the more ridiculous aspects of
        its freeform gunplay better than any Far Cry game in recent memory –
        though I think it also leans a little too heavily on the trope of
        “grizzled-yet-goofy” veteran fighters.
        <br /><br />
        There are certainly some great character moments throughout, and the
        decision to return Far Cry to third-person cutscenes is a good one,
        especially if you choose the femme version of main character Dani Rojas.
        That’s thanks to an earnest performance by actress Nisa Gunduz, who in
        no way feels like she’s playing second fiddle to the big–name celebrity
        on the box art. The rest of the voice cast is solid, too – particularly
        Glow’s Shakira Barrera, who’s beleaguered rancher–turned–rebel is easily
        one of the best supporting characters you’ll run into. Similarly,
        relative newcomer Xavier Lopez shines in some powerful moments, and it’s
        great to see trans characters not only included but played by a trans
        actor – though nuance can still be a bit tricky for Far Cry.
      </p>
      <h2>
        FC6 clearly wants to be a more socially responsible game than its
        predecessors.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        FC6 clearly wants to be a more socially responsible game than its
        predecessors and – to its credit – it does make an effort to tackle some
        social issues, even if the script might stumble a bit over the reality
        of some of those moments. But it still feels trapped between presenting
        an authentic representation of Latin American culture and a gonzo’d-up
        version designed to please mainstream Western audiences. The world
        itself seems like a gorgeous rendition of South and Central American
        life, but the script sometimes relies so heavily on specific
        colloquialisms that it feels like it borders on caricature. Or, more
        egregiously, there’s the cockfighting minigame that’s basically Mortal
        Kombat with chickens. I know it’s technically legal in Cuba but...
        yeesh.
        <br /><br />
        While previous Far Cry games have mostly pitted us against pirates,
        mercenaries, and cultists (not to mention mutants, evil cavemen, and
        cyber commandos), Far Cry 6 makes its bad guys a properly organized and
        equipped army. It’s a little straight–laced, given the series’ origins,
        but it also provides more diverse and engaging encounters. Enemy
        Captains can call in reinforcements or airstrikes to flush you out of
        your sniper’s nest, while Medics will revive wounded comrades and
        engineers will mount auto-turrets. They’re a good addition to the usual
        roster of “shotgun guy, molotov guy, and heavy guy” that gives you
        interesting reasons to prioritize your targets beyond simply “who might
        see or shoot at me next.”
        <br /><br />
        On top of that, Far Cry 6 is the strongest the series has ever been when
        it comes to turning fleets of trucks, helicopters, and tanks into fiery
        metal scrap. While it’s still super satisfying to clear a checkpoint
        without raising an alarm or even an eyebrow (this is how I spent most of
        my playthrough), there’s a very special brand of joy that comes from
        speeding down a highway trashing a convoy with mounted machine guns
        while blasting Ricky Martin, and the sizeable arsenal FC6 puts at your
        disposal makes going loud an especially appealing option this time
        around.
      </p>
      <h2>
        I just can’t say no to an electric buggy that hot-swaps into a
        paraglider.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Taking a cue from 2019’s Far Cry: New Dawn, FC6 provides not just the
        usual truckload of real-world weapons but also a selection of what it
        calls “Resolver Weapons” and Rides, named for the Cuban idiom for
        “making do with what you have" that arose after the US embargos took
        effect in the ‘60s. These ramshackle killamajigs range from a portable
        EMP cannon, which is great for disabling tanks and helicopters, to my
        personal favorite: a minigun made out of an old motorcycle engine that
        can be upgraded to fire incendiary rounds. There are also a handful of
        similarly jury–rigged vehicles to find around the world. They lacked the
        firepower and armor plating of your more personalized vehicles, but
        their multifunction designs made them invaluable to getting around
        Yara’s massive map – plus I just can’t say no to an electric buggy that
        hot-swaps into a paraglider.
        <br /><br />
        Rounding out your arsenal are Supremos, which are effectively Ultimate
        Abilities duct-taped to a backpack along with a bunch of depleted
        uranium. Each one has a unique function, be it a rocket barrage to clear
        out enemy strongholds or a salvo of poison bombs that can cause
        hallucinations and turn soldiers against each other. I primarily swapped
        between the rocket pack and one that gave me basically ghost vision –
        yeah, there’s some supernatural stuff to find when you wander off the
        main story path – and take out enemies through walls, though others,
        like the self-reviving Medic pack were equally helpful when I chose not
        to have one of the Amigo animal companions at my side.
        <br /><br />
        Changing up your arsenal is a lot more important this time around, too.
        Enemies now have unique resistances and vulnerabilities to certain types
        of ammo, and that – combined with the health bars that appear over their
        heads like in New Dawn – had me concerned early on that every firefight
        would devolve into a frustrating ammo sink against a bunch of unkillable
        bullet sponges. Thankfully, you can turn the health bars off in the
        options menu (the HUD is fully customizable, down to the color of roads
        on your map), and it was good to see that FC6 includes a welcome suite
        of accessibility options.
        <br /><br />
        It took a few hours to amass enough weapons to feel “ready for
        anything,” but the careful balancing of Far Cry 6’s increasing power
        level versus my own meant taking someone down rarely felt tedious. And
        while that’s a welcome new idea, it’s the moments when you have to
        switch from stealth to action on the fly where the biggest change to the
        Far Cry formula simultaneously shines and... stumbles hard.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The constant need to shuffle my inventory was a tedious interruption to
        otherwise enjoyable action.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In Far Cry 6, abilities that this series had previously unlocked in
        RPG-style skill trees are now attached to armor and mods for your
        weapons and gear. It’s satisfying to use the wide variety of gadgets to
        create playstyle loadouts for each Supremo, and the number of unlockable
        gadgets provides a lot of variety – from classics like proximity mines
        and C4 to new introductions like perception grenades, which
        automatically tag enemies for you (huge time saver!). Moving perks and
        bonuses over to mods and clothing really leans into FC6’s emphasis on
        crafting and customization, even if some of the armor bonuses feel like
        they should be permanently unlockable. It makes sense to tie things like
        quieter movement to a pair of soft-soled shoes or improved fire
        resistance to a Nomex jacket, but why do I need to be wearing a specific
        hat to perform a takedown out of stealth?
        <br /><br />
        This would work really well if there were a similarly easy–to–swap
        loadout system for armor and weapons, but without that (or even just the
        ability to Favorite an item) the constant need to shuffle my inventory
        was, at the best of times, a brief dip into a clunky UI and at worst
        (and much more often) a tedious interruption to what is otherwise really
        enjoyable action.
        <br /><br />
        This became even more of an issue when adding a friend into the mix,
        since the pause function of the single-player game is removed when
        playing in co-op mode. That said, teaming up to stealthily take out
        military installations or complete one of the Operations together was
        good fun. Similar to New Dawn’s Expeditions, these one-off missions
        (which can also be played solo) take you to locations beyond the bounds
        of the open-world map (though they still allegedly take place somewhere
        in Yara?). There were only two available during the review period – one
        to the ruins of a town recently devastated by a huge mudslide, another
        to a robot dinosaur theme park that in no way infringes on the copyright
        of any Steven Spielberg movies. They’re a fun side activity and a good
        way to test your collaborative skills with a friend, but for my money,
        Far Cry 6 is at the top of its game when wreaking havoc across the
        countryside – whether you’re with a buddy or on your own.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Teaming up to stealthily take out military installations or complete one

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        If just causing random chaos isn’t your bag, there are plenty of side
        quests and off-the-beaten-path activities, and almost all of the ones I
        dug into were either fun diversions from the weighty task of liberating
        an entire country or deepened my relationship and understanding of the
        supporting cast – and sometimes both. Given just how much of Far Cry 6
        there is, my map was still probably 20% unexplored by the time I rolled
        credits, and I’m looking forward to diving back in and seeing what I
        missed – though I hope there aren’t many more with a heavy focus on
        platforming.
        <br /><br />
        Platforming has never necessarily been a cornerstone of the Far Cry
        series, but I also don’t remember the jumping and climbing mechanics
        being as finicky as they are in Six. It’s a relatively minor gripe, but
        while some games are very clear that “you can only climb on the blue
        ledges,” the indicators in Far Cry 6 are much less consistent. Some
        climbable objects are clearly marked in orange. Others in blue. You can
        only climb these vines but you can also mantle onto ledges that have
        other vines on them, but not every ledge, because some are just a hair
        too high and others aren’t high enough. To be clear, most of the time
        I’m able to clamber over boxes or onto roofs just fine, but when I’m
        trying to avoid getting machine-gunned to death and get stuck slamming
        my face into a concrete wall, it’s more than a little frustrating.
        <br /><br />
        This was probably the most irritating technical issue I ran into playing
        on an Xbox Series X, though it wasn’t the only one. Apart from a couple
        of freezes or crashes during load screens over 30 hours, though, most of
        the bugs I ran into were very minor. Some framerate slowdown during
        cutscenes or driving through dense foliage here, a couple of unbalanced
        or dropped audio tracks there, and the very rare need to reload a
        checkpoint.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Far Cry 6 is some of the most fun I’ve had with this series in nearly a
        decade. Its cast delivers strong performances across an enjoyable story,
        even if it’s also a fairly predictable one that doesn’t always land the
        bigger swings it tries to take. And despite some faltering new inventory
        mechanics and a handful of bizarre design choices, its creative weaponry
        means taking down an outpost, ransacking a convoy, or even just taking a
        ride with a buddy has never felt better.
