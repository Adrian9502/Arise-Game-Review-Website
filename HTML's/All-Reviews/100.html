      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        Criminals are an ugly, cowardly lot more worthy of pity and disdain than
        admiration. This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player
        campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV. The series cheered (and
        criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's
        gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent
        civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many,
        many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very
        soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth
        previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere
        shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new
        masterpiece is worthy of applause. Without question, Grand Theft Auto IV
        is the best game since Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
        <br /><br />
        You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his
        past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to
        experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may
        have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko
        makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad-ass foreigner who appears
        to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that
        there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to
        escape the person he once was.
        <br /><br />
        Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor
        are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters
        and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes
        mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to
        become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never
        inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a
        brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we
        feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic.
        <br /><br />
        Much of the credit goes to the artists at Rockstar North who created as
        believable a city as possible. Liberty City is inspired by New York, but
        not beholden to it. While there are many parallels, Liberty exists in
        its own universe and rightfully so. Many open-world games have cities
        that feel as if they existed only from the moment you first turned on
        your console, but Liberty City looks lived in. It's an old city and each
        block has its own vibe and its own history.
        <br /><br />
        Drive around Liberty City and you'll be able to identify each individual
        block. Though Liberty is filled with brownstones and a myriad of similar
        brick buildings, you can tell one from the other, just as you can in New
        York. Go to an affluent neighborhood and the street is likely to be
        newly paved, the pedestrians better dressed, the cops more plentiful.
        But head to Dukes or Bohan and you'll find streets nearly stripped of
        asphalt, homeless people wandering about aimlessly and criminals preying
        on the weak.
        <br /><br />
        Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I
        saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right
        before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man
        got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was
        okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These
        were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just
        one moment in a day full of incidents.
        <br /><br />
        Hang in one area of the city long enough and you'll see how traffic and
        pedestrian flow changes as the day progresses. When it rains, people
        bring out umbrellas or shield themselves with a newspaper and run for an
        awning. Cops chase petty thieves unaware that walking down the street is
        Niko Bellic, cold-blooded killer. There's a perfect balance of mumbling
        doomsayers to remind you that the reason this city never sleeps is
        because it's full of nut jobs. People go about their day, only altering
        course when Niko inserts himself into their lives with his crappy
        driving or excellent marksmanship.
        <br /><br />
        Liberty City isn't as big as San Andreas, but is far denser. There's a
        lot to see and do and, like New York itself, very little wasted space.
        When you enter buildings, there are no load times -- you open the door
        and you're on your way up a flight of stairs to the roof. The only
        frustration is that there are literally thousands of buildings in the
        city, but most of them cannot be entered. With the exception of some
        clearly marked entertainment hot spots and mission-specific areas,
        there's nothing to indicate which buildings are open for business. So
        you might find yourself walking into a lot of doors trying to find which
        one will magically open. It's a little much to expect to have the
        interiors of every building rendered, but that doesn't make it any less
        bothersome that you can't go where you please.
        <br /><br />
        The idea of a "living, breathing city" has always been somewhat of a
        joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way.
        But Liberty City feels like a real place. And its history is built not
        only into the architecture and the people, but even in the music. There
        are more than 200 songs in GTA IV and many of them were recorded or
        remastered with specific references to Liberty City. You'll hear songs
        on the Classics station referencing the city, as if to suggest there's
        decades of history built into the culture. The soundtrack is an
        unbelievable blend of rock, pop, reggae, R&B and hip-hop. But more
        astounding is how well the songs and the DJs blend into the city itself.
        <br /><br />
        It's this level of integration that makes Liberty City such a believable
        place. You won't just hear "America's Next Whore" advertised on the
        radio; you'll see posters when walking down the street and spot ads on
        the Internet. GTA IV takes aim at all of the modern forms of
        communication. Along with radio stations (a staple of the series) there
        are full programs and ads you can watch on TV and a fully browseable
        Interweb.
        <br /><br />
        You could lose hours of your day surfing the 'net. That may mean sorting
        through junk mail, clicking on random links, using Love-Meet.com to find
        dates, or reading the news. There are multiple websites that cover news
        based on missions Niko's completed. You can read different takes on
        these events if you want to get an idea of how your actions are
        perceived in different political corners. You might never bother looking
        at all, but like so much of GTA IV, there are dozens of hours of content
        waiting to be either discovered or ignored.

        "The idea of a 'living, breathing city' has always been somewhat of a

        But Liberty City feels like a real place."
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        To make itself more modern -- as opposed to Vice City and San Andreas
        which were "of an era" -- the focal point of Niko's world is his cell
        phone. You'll receive calls and text messages from friends and business
        associates on your phone. This is the mission delivery system. You may
        launch into a mission just by answering a call, but more often you will
        be directed to meet at a specific location to initiate your next
        objective. Or you might just have a conversation that serves no purpose
        other than to deepen the characterization of Niko, his friends, or even
        his enemies. The good news is that, just like in real life, you can talk
        on the phone while driving your bus through a police blockade.
        <br /><br />
        The phone is also used as an organizer to remind you of critical events
        (dates with slutty online girls) and can be customized with new
        ringtones and wallpapers. And just as in modern life, the phone can
        become a nuisance. Date Carmen and she will constantly be ringing your
        digits and sending texts checking in to make sure you aren't sleeping
        with some other girl. Yes, there are needy people even in Liberty City.
        You'll also get casual calls during missions. You can always ignore the
        ring or you can pick up. It's most likely a friend calling and asking to
        hang out. GTA is a clever game brimming with hundreds of thousands of
        lines of dialogue and Niko will almost certainly have a pun-laced
        response to turn down a pal if he's in the middle of a helicopter
        dogfight.
        <br /><br />
        This doesn't mean you shouldn't give your potential friends the time of
        day. Throughout Niko's journey you'll have the opportunity to strengthen
        your bond with some of the people you meet. It's not necessary to take
        your Jamaican braddah Little Jacob out for a drink or game of pool when
        he calls, but doing so is to your benefit. If someone likes you enough,
        they'll give you access to their special ability. For Little Jacob, that
        means being able to call him day or night for discounted weapons.
        Packie, the angry Irish wannabe mobster gives you car bombs. Dwayne
        sends a pair of his homies to assist you on missions.
        <br /><br />
        The benefits of taking friends out on the town go beyond these tangible
        attributes. Friends also provide commentary on life, the city, Niko, and
        the story. None of it is essential to completing the game, but all of it
        is fascinating. The dialogue in GTA IV is rich, funny, brilliant,
        insightful, and engaging. So many times your reward for beating a
        mission isn't a new weapon or an elaborate cinematic cut-scene -- it's
        just dialogue. That is often reward enough.
      </p>
      <h2>
        "There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked
        into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a
        long-sought revenge."
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There are a number of places you can take your friends when you go out
        on the town and you should base your decision on what they might enjoy.
        There are mini-games for darts, pool, and bowling. But you can also
        check out the god-awful cabaret or watch one of several comedy sets by
        Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams. Perhaps the most challenging (but
        satisfying) activity is going drinking.
        <br /><br />
        Your level of drunkenness is relative to the person you take out. Little
        Jacob and Dwayne aren't so bad, but take a sweet lass like Kate out and
        she'll have you (literally) falling over yourself. When drunk, it's
        difficult to walk and even more of a challenge to drive. You don't have
        to drive drunk (in fact, it might make you ill doing so as the camera
        sways as if you're out at sea), but it's fun to give it a try. Drunk
        friends tend to be more revealing as well. Kate will tell you what she
        really thinks of you with just a few drinks. If that doesn't weaken your
        self esteem, nothing will.
        <br /><br />
        The only issue with making friends is that it's a distraction from the
        main story. For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a
        greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the
        city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so
        compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its
        conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are
        so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are
        each immediately identifiable and unique.
        <br /><br />
        Some are loveable, but there are many who are despicable. There are
        cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the
        depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a
        long-sought revenge. That's a credit to the writing, to make what would
        normally just be some thug you're doing missions for earn your contempt.
        That's a mark that you care for Niko; that the story has gotten to you.
        There aren't many games that can pull that off.
        <br /><br />
        As an added twist, GTA IV gives you occasional morality choices. There
        are people that you don't have to kill in a mission and you can decide
        whether or not to waste a bullet. These events don't change the plot or
        open new missions later on. Occasionally it affects dialogue, but more
        often it is simply the game asking what kind of person you are. And
        there are some gut-wrenching decisions you make at points that create an
        emotional response I never imagined I would get from a Grand Theft Auto
        title. There is one significant choice you make towards the end of the
        game that opens a new path and an alternate ending. There are two
        worthwhile endings to uncover and are incentive for playing through a
        second time just to see how much more depressing life in Liberty City
        can get.
        <br /><br />
        There are more than 90 story missions that will take anywhere from 25-45
        hours to complete depending largely on your skill level. I was certain
        that the missions would get repetitive at some point, that sooner or
        later it would get redundant. It never does. Though many missions boil
        down to the same basic parameter -- go to location, kill people to get
        to target, chase target, kill target -- it never feels repetitive. The
        locations of missions, the variety in the enemies, the dynamic aspects
        of the AI, and the dialogue keep GTA IV from ever feeling stale. In
        fact, this is a game that can be enjoyed with multiple playthroughs.
        It's just that good.
        <br /><br />
        The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie
        McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for
        Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank
        surrounded and there's no easy way out. Instead, you and the gang must
        battle through the streets and into the subway to escape. It's a
        lengthy, epic fight that I could replay a dozen times and still enjoy.
        <br /><br />
        A great deal of that pleasure is due to the refined combat system.
        Though Grand Theft Auto has always been about action, it has never
        provided a great targeting system. That has finally, truly changed with
        GTA IV. Hold down the trigger and you can lock on to an enemy (or
        civilian). You'll see an indicator of their health. You can adjust your
        aim slightly with the thumbstick so that nudging up a little can help
        you earn some headshots. Partially depress the trigger and you have free
        aim, which is great for targeting tires or specific body parts. With
        skill, you can take down enemies faster in free mode. But auto aim is a
        great help in larger battles or for those who aren't as adept with a
        controller.
        <br /><br />
        Better is the cover system. Tap the right shoulder button and you'll
        take cover behind the nearest object. If you see it in the environment,
        you can probably take cover behind it. That includes walls, dumpsters
        and cars. You can aim while in cover and when you hold the trigger to
        fire, you'll pop and shoot. You can also blind fire rather effectively
        with any weapon -- including an RPG. The cover system is fairly smart,
        so if you want to move from one side of a door to the other, just push
        towards where you want to go and tap the cover button. This also works
        when you are fairly far from cover. Niko will roll or perform a slick
        slide to get to safety quickly. There is a stickiness to the cover
        system similar to Gears of War, but since the cover button isn't tied to
        your run button, you never accidentally enter cover.
        <br /><br />
        While GTA doesn't have many issues, I will admit that the cover system
        is not perfect. There are times where you will take cover on the wrong
        side of a corner, leaving you exposed. These instances aren't too
        common, but over the course of dozens of hours, you'll certainly
        encounter them. You also un-stick from cover when you use your phone,
        which can sometimes make calling Dwayne for backup or Carmen for a
        health boost a little trickier than necessary.

      <p>
        Most games with a cover system make the mistake of turning cover into
        the central focus of gameplay. But cover in GTA IV is more of a natural
        progression needed to facilitate heightened AI. Enemies have a variety
        of AI protocols. Some are cowards (gotta love the fat cops running for
        the hills when you start killing the boys in blue), most try to avoid
        being shot by taking cover, and a few still stand in the open. If the AI
        is going to be able to hide behind cars and other parts of the
        environment, it's only fair that players have the same ability.
        <br /><br />
        You don't have to use cover if you don't want to. I'm sure there is some
        way to beat missions just by running and gunning. After all, this is
        still GTA. There's no one right way to beat a mission. You're free to
        get creative. But ignoring the cover system is like never stealing a
        car. This is a major piece of the game. Use it often, because it works
        well and it's certain to keep you alive longer.
        <br /><br />
        The cops aren't about to let Niko run through the city with guns
        blazing, even if he is capping bad guys. Sooner or later, you'll run
        afoul of the law. The wanted system has been revised and makes for more
        dynamic chase scenes. When you're wanted, your radar displays the police
        search parameter. The smaller the wanted level, the more local the
        search. Your goal is to get out of that circle and avoid being seen by
        the cops. Get spotted and the circle re-centers on your new location.
        This becomes more of a challenge when you reach three stars, because a
        police helicopter appears. This eye in the sky has an easier chance of
        spotting and following Niko -- and directing other cops to your
        location.
        <br /><br />
        Unless you want to be O.J., you need to change directions, get out of
        the sight of choppers, switch cars or go on foot. Whatever you do, avoid
        line of sight, because once a cop sees you, you're location is reported
        and the search changes its focus. This makes escapes from four stars and
        higher incredibly intense. Pay 'n' Spray shops still exist, but must be
        entered when cops aren't looking. To be honest, I used this one time in
        40 hours. It's an outdated idea in some ways and more a nod to GTA's of
        old than a great resource.
        <br /><br />
        The new wanted system puts an emphasis on your driving and navigation
        skills. Fortunately, you can set a waypoint on the map in the pause menu
        and get an adaptive GPS-guided route. This same system is used to guide
        you through missions. There is never a point in GTA IV where you have to
        wonder where to go or what to do next.

        "That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed
        open world, runs so well and with such short load times is a technical
        marvel."
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        I should mention that the driving has also seen an upgrade from past
        Grand Theft Autos. Rockstar's RAGE engine coupled with NaturalMotion's
        Euphoria engine creates a game world with some stunning physics. Each
        brand of car handles differently (you can actually see the suspension in
        action as you make sharp turns). What will really surprise people is
        that these physics work with characters while in cars. So Niko's weight
        shifts to one side as he makes a turn and his head snaps forward when he
        slams the brakes. There is also a full neurological system built into
        Niko so that his body knows how to react to other objects. At one point
        I drove an ambulance off a high stunt jump. The cinematic camera swung
        around to show Niko taking his hands off the wheel and covering his face
        before impact.
        <br /><br />
        You will see the effects of NaturalMotion throughout the game, whether
        it's how bodies react when you slam your car into them or the way a
        gangbanger leaps away from a grenade. The physics system is the
        connective tissue that grounds the action into something resembling
        reality. And it's one of the main factors that makes GTA such an
        impressive-looking game.
        <br /><br />
        Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical
        glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the
        PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to
        the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate
        hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture
        pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with
        great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so
        well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I
        can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.
        <br /><br />
        The art team gets major kudos for creating a living world. There is
        great texture work in the environments, a nice field-of-vision blur of
        buildings in the distance, some excellently modeled cars, ball-jarring
        explosions, phenomenal water effects and one interesting-looking Eastern
        Euro for a lead character. Sure, it's not a game that runs perfectly all
        the time, but the technical elements almost never get in the way of the
        gameplay.
        <br /><br />
        For those wanting to know which version looks better, the edge goes to
        the PS3. The textures and framerate are comparable, but the PS3 has far
        less pop-in. The 360 has richer colors, but the PS3 has better
        anti-aliasing making it look a little cleaner. Because GTA IV can
        preload onto the PS3 hard drive, the in-game loads are faster. Don't
        worry Xbox owners, the load times are rarely more than 30 seconds and
        don't occur very often. The slight visual edge goes to PS3, but the 360
        is no slouch. Either version will do you proud.
        <br /><br />
        If you're wondering which version to buy, the best suggestion is to
        consider what your friends will purchase. That's because online
        multiplayer has made its way into GTA IV and it is awesome. And, like
        all great things, it's best played when drunk and with as many friends
        as possible.
        <br /><br />
        Multiplayer is accessed via your phone from the single-player game.
        Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians,
        traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of
        your closest friends.
        <br /><br />
        To keep you and your pals from getting separated, GTA IV offers a party
        system. The party lobby is actually set in the outskirts of Liberty
        City. You're given plenty of guns and some vehicles to mess around with.
        You can stay and fight or run around the city if you like while waiting
        for the host to set up a match. And boy, are there a lot of options to
        choose from.
        <br /><br />
        There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and
        free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free
        Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up
        to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom
        games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with
        almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the
        match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted
        level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available
        -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very
        core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem.
        Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals.
        <br /><br />
        There are a number of other creative multiplayer offerings. The standard
        Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch can be interesting, since the cover
        system often slows the game a bit so it isn't as fast-paced as something
        like Quake. Unless, of course, you choose "all rockets" in which case
        death will become you many, many times. Mafiya Work has you and your
        competitors receiving phone errands from a mob boss. First to complete a
        mission scores some cash. Car Jack City has players vying to steal
        specially marked cars and return them in as pristine a condition as
        possible to a drop off point. Turf War is your standard
        capture-the-point. Or if you like vehicles you can try out GTA Race,
        which is like any other racing game except you can get out of your
        vehicle, jack your competitor's car and finish the race in any way you
        like -- or just blow up other people for the hell of it.

      <p>
        And then there is Cops n' Crooks, the best of the objective-based
        multiplayer games. This has two teams, one side lawmen, the other
        hoodlums. The crooks are trying to get to a randomly selected extraction
        point and the cops are trying to arrest them with bullets. This mode
        forces teamwork, as both teams must strategize on the fly and rely on
        one another to assist in navigation. It's a fun, addictive mode that
        will likely be the most popular of the team offerings.
        <br /><br />
        On top of the various competitive modes, there are also three co-op
        offerings. These three "modes" are missions similar to what you might
        experience in the single-player game. Niko doesn't exist in multiplayer,
        but you still get cut-scenes and some unique dialogue wrapped around
        some fun missions. Co-op supports up to four players and only has some
        minor variables. Your objective never changes nor do the locations. You
        can up the difficulty and add more traffic if you want a challenge, but
        none of the co-op missions struck me as anything worth playing more than
        a couple of times. It's nice to have, but probably won't be what gamers
        buzz about when discussing GTA multiplayer.
        <br /><br />
        As with just about every game, there are both ranked and unranked
        matches. Ranked matches are the only way to progress up the ranking
        system (from 0-10). Progressing up the ranks not only makes you feel
        better about yourself, but it opens up new clothing and accessories to
        better customize your character. There's not a lot of pull to rank up,
        though, because many of the modes don't use your custom character. The
        co-op modes and Cops n' Crooks use a different cast, so if those tend to
        be your primary focus, having new outfits for a character you never see
        isn't going to mean much.
        <br /><br />
        I won't go so far as to say that GTA IV is the best multiplayer out
        there, but it's definitely among the best. Having Liberty City in full
        effect and only seeing occasional instances of slowdown is a real treat.
        When a few million people load hop online, it's anyone's guess how the
        game will hold up, but from my experience, playing with 16 people in
        Free Mode only caused occasional hiccups. Certainly not enough to make
        me stop playing.
        <br /><br />
        For those curious about SIXAXIS controls, there are in full force in GTA
        IV. You can guide boats, bikes and cars tilting the controller. This
        only works well with boats, however, as bikes are far too squirrelly for
        the clumsy movements of SIXAXIS control. Helicopters are also very tough
        to control in this fashion -- it's as if Rockstar thought they were
        making a game about dragons. The mini-games, particularly bowling, also
        work with your guided movements and handle well. If you want traditional
        controls, you can turn SIXAXIS off for each individual input -- from the
        various vehicle types to reloading guns to specific mini-games. It's
        worth giving SIXAXIS a shot, but most likely you will shut this off.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Grand Theft Auto III was a revolutionary title, one that inspired a
        whole new generation of 3D action games. Grand Theft Auto IV is just as
        big a leap forward, though perhaps in subtler ways, and sets a new
        benchmark for open-world games. Everything in GTA IV works in harmony.
        The story would be nothing without the city; the city gains realism from
        the physics engine; the physics complement the improved AI; the AI would
        make no sense without the new cover system. And on and on. There is no
        one major weak aspect. A "10" is not a score we give out very often. In
        fact, the last time we gave a 10 to a console game was Soul Calibur in
        1999. A 10 doesn't mean a game is perfect -- it means a game is pushing
        boundaries, expanding a genre, and doing many things to a level so far
        above and beyond its competitors that they overshadows any flaws.
        Certainly, GTA IV has some issues, the most noticeable being the
        occasional flaw in the cover system, but there are many more pieces of
        GTA IV that are better than anything I've seen from a game in the past
        decade. We don't give 10s often -- just to games that merit the score.
