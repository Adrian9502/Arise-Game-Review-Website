      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        The tension before you breach a room in Rainbow Six Siege is often
        palpable. I’ll place a charge on one door while our sniper Glaz watches
        the windows from outside, and then wait for our teammate playing
        Dokkaebi to distract the enemies with a phone call before blowing it
        wide open. Coordination is key, and working together to get the most out
        of each our Operators’ abilities can be even more valuable as landing a
        good headshot – though the headshots definitely help.
        <br /><br />
        Siege has come a long way since it launched two years ago (read our
        original Rainbow Six Siege review). A steady stream of new maps,
        operators, and cosmetic items - along with a heaping helping of bug
        fixes, balance changes, and stability improvements - have slowly
        transformed it into a much deeper competitive game, even if there are
        some growing pains that come along with that. Siege has always been a
        fun and challenging FPS, but as it enters its third year it has gained a
        pull that’s become hard to resist.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Learning which door to barricade can win you more games than just
        outgunning your opponent.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Each round of a match starts with a frantic race as one side sets up
        their defenses and the other hunts for intel with remote-controlled
        drones. It’s game of cat and mouse that often devolves into hilarious,
        Benny Hilly-style chases as the defenders try to deny the attackers of
        as much information as possible. It’s only a minute long, but there are
        a lot of subtle nuances in what walls to reinforce and where to place
        your traps that can differentiate the good players from the great.
        <br /><br />
        Most of its levels are set in buildings with three stories, giving its
        gunfights a sense of height that many shooters lack. They’re also
        littered with destructible walls and floors, letting you create your own
        paths with breaching charges or even break small holes in defending
        walls to create new lines of sight. It makes Siege an immediately more
        accessible game, empowering you with the ability to improve your win
        rate through learning the maps alone, even if your aim doesn’t get any
        better.
        <br /><br />
        There are currently 15 maps in the casual matchmaking queue, only nine
        of which are in ranked, each visually distinct and set in different
        locations across the globe, which results in a fantastic amount of
        variety every time I sit down to play. I love that I often won’t see the
        same map twice in an evening of games, but the flipside is that it takes
        longer to actually learn the layouts of those maps. Still, it’s a
        tradeoff that ultimately improves Siege.
        <br /><br />
        Talking the Talk
        <br /><br />
        Working with your teammates, either through voice chat, text, or just
        map markers and pings is a simple but extremely impactful thing you can
        do to get better at Siege. It can be a big ask to rely on the voices of
        internet strangers (and Siege definitely has its fair share of
        unfriendly and unhelpful players) but overall I’ve been pleasantly
        surprised by how this community understands and embraces good
        communication as a tool.
        <br /><br />
        A great example of how communication can win games is with security
        cameras and drones. You can use cameras to mark the location of enemies
        for your whole team, but doing so will also warn the marked player that
        they’ve been seen, often resulting in them quickly hunting down and
        destroying that camera. But if you don’t mark enemies, and instead talk
        to your teammates and tell them where that person is, you can give them
        the same information without alerting your opponent. You can still use
        those same cameras after you’ve died too, which cleverly cuts out a lot
        of down-time as you continue to help any surviving teammates.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, you’ll still run into plenty of people mindlessly tagging
        with cameras in public matchmaking. Like many competitive games, Siege
        is almost always more fun when played with friends I can comfortably
        coordinate with. Timing breaches and calling out flash grenades will let
        you get the drop on a defending team, but the short two to three-minute
        rounds and setup period between those tense moments also leaves room for
        goofing off in between.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Bringing the grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking
        for trouble, so plan carefully.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Siege has just three PvP game modes, all of which revolve around one
        team protecting a room (or two rooms, in the case of the Bomb mode) and
        the other team trying to break through their defenses. They are
        different enough in subtle ways that influence what walls you want to
        reinforce or which operators you should use - for example, bringing the
        blind grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for
        trouble - but the general approach either team takes in a given mode can
        feel a little too similar.
        <br /><br />
        As a side activity to the competitive battles there’s the PvE Terrorist
        Hunt mode and the single-player Situations. Both of these modes are
        great, and I often find myself warming up for PvP by taking on the AI
        first. The Situations are runs through the same multiplayer maps against
        AI, and can feel as compelling as a fully built-out single-player
        mission at times, which makes it a bit disappointing that we haven’t
        seen any new ones as everything else grows around it. (The first season
        of year three begins in March, and is expected to add a new kind of PvE
        mode called Outbreak, which will hopefully be a bit of what I’m hoping
        for.)
        <br /><br />
        Role Call
        <br /><br />
        Another way Siege has grown is its ever-expanding cast of Operators.
        Sixteen new characters have been added so far, which makes a current
        total of 36 with eight more coming in the next year. The result is more
        dynamic and varied matches, both in how you play and who you have to
        play against. Unlike the maps, it’s much easier to remember what each
        operator does, which helps the large roster not feel daunting to learn.
        You only really have to keep track of their special ability and what
        type of gun they might be using, but they’re still unique enough to
        leave ample room for different playstyles and strategies.
        <br /><br />
        An operator like Mira completely changes the landscape of a map when
        picked, with the ability to put impenetrable one-way mirrors into
        otherwise solid walls. Other operators like Caveira, who can silence her
        footsteps and then interrogate downed enemies to learn the position of
        their teammates, or Vigil, who can become invisible to cameras and
        drones, are built to be played as aggressive, roaming defenders. Their
        presence enables new strategies that simply weren’t as viable at launch.
        Abilities like this have changed Siege in very real ways, and the
        increased options keep Siege from ever feeling repetitive.
        <br /><br />
        Better still, the benefit of that variety can be felt even if you don’t
        have these new operators unlocked for yourself. I didn’t necessarily
        feel like I was at a disadvantage by not having any given character, as
        very few operators in Siege feel like either “must picks” or completely
        underpowered. I wished I could use certain locked operators, sure, but
        the 20 base operators that have been there from the beginning are still
        strong, fun, and varied enough to make the significantly higher Renown
        cost (Siege’s in-game currency) of any that came after them less
        frustrating.
        <br /><br />
        You don’t start with any Operators unlocked, with the original 20
        costing between 500 and 2,500 Renown, a relatively small amount that
        comes quickly enough from playing matches. All the new operators,
        however, are a massive 25,000. It can take at least 20 hours of play (on
        the low-end) to gather that much renown, but you also have the option to
        buy operators with real money for $5 a pop.
        <br /><br />
        With only eight released in a year, 25,000 renown isn’t so hard to
        collect for regular players who have kept up to date, but it’s pretty
        steep for newcomers who are trying to catch up. Siege does feel like it
        has been set up to encourage players to spend real money on its
        year-long passes, which provide every new operator released in their
        given time period (plus some extra premium currency and other goodies)
        for $30. It’s akin to an annual subscription fee, but nearly everything
        but some premium cosmetics can be earned without spending any money
        beyond buying the base game.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It's disappointing that the Year-One operators haven’t dropped in price
        since their release.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That said, I’m disappointed that the Year-One operators haven’t dropped
        in price since their release. The Year-One and Year-Two passes have both
        left the store, and the one option to get them cheaper is a slightly
        discounted bundle only available for real money. I’d love to see these
        older operators drop to a Renown cost to make them more inviting to new
        players once their release hype has long passed.
        <br /><br />
        The store, in general, suffers from growing pains that Siege has yet to
        address. A massive amount of cosmetic gun skins, gun charms, and
        operator outfits are available, with new ones arriving as often as
        weekly. Nearly all of these cosmetics can be unlocked with Renown, and
        some of them are extremely cool. The gun skins, in particular, tend to
        be varied and gorgeous, everything from being textured like gems to
        having detailed tigers stretching up the barrel. Many of the most recent
        operator outfits and headgear options have started branching into cool
        and creative territory beyond just different shades of camo, like
        Valkyrie’s Pop Art make-up or Blackbeard’s dapper top hat.
        <br /><br />
        The problem, however, is that the store itself has become a big pile of
        stuff that’s nearly impossible to navigate. It’s hard to browse and hard
        to search, especially when it comes to bundles. Items will helpfully
        tell you if they are available in a bundle, but there’s no way to then
        go to that bundle directly, and the bundles tab is an ungodly long text
        list with a single image to explain everything that’s in it.
        <br /><br />
        Siege wisely keeps the items in its store away from anything that really
        affects gameplay. There are a variety of gun scopes and barrel
        attachments that can be unlocked with Renown that do offer mid-match
        advantages, but they are cheap enough that this power boost never felt
        walled off or like it was compromising balance.
        <br /><br />
        And, once again, what your gun looks like and the scope you are using
        can mean next to nothing if your opponent can simply outthink you. Siege
        has continued to double down on that focus on smart play over the years,
        and it’s made it a game I want to keep playing for a long time to come.
        Looking forward, Ubisoft has already laid out a free update plan for
        Siege’s third year, including eight more operators, two new maps, and
        the Outbreak game mode, meaning things don’t show any sign of slowing
        down.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Rainbow Six Siege’s focus on teamwork and strategy over just aiming
        prowess sets it apart in exciting ways, and the constant stream of new
        maps and operators have made it a wonderfully varied FPS. All that new
        content has made it harder for new players to catch up, and I wish more
        work had been done to address this, but smart play and good
        communication will still win you more games than having the newest
        operator. It’s got some growing pains to sort out, but the future
        continues to look bright for Siege.
