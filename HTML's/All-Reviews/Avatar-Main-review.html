      <p>
        Short of somehow growing a Na’vi neural braid and jamming it directly
        into the base of James Cameron’s skull, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is
        pretty much your best option for taking a virtual tour of the stunning
        alien moon of Pandora. This open-world shooter serves up a mind
        bogglingly large slice of the fantastic fictional universe to explore,
        from staggeringly dense forest areas to picturesque open plains and
        properly intimidating mountain ranges both on land and suspended
        impossibly in the skies above. However, hidden amongst all that beauty
        is a disappointing amount of bloat, with copy-pasted enemy outposts and
        facilities that made venturing off the main story path far less
        rewarding than it has been in recent landmark adventures such as Elden
        Ring or the last two Legend of Zeldas. I still largely enjoyed the 25
        hours I spent trying to fend off a resource-hungry human invasion, but I
        wish the environment itself had presented me with more compelling
        reasons to fight for it beyond its surface-level splendor.
        <br /><br />
        I must admit that the two Avatar films have each impressed me far more
        on a technical level than they have with the quality of their
        storytelling, and in that regard Frontiers of Pandora remains true to
        its box office record-breaking inspiration. Set on an entirely new
        Western Frontier continent separate from the region where Jake Sully and
        family have played out two parts of an apparently five-movie story arc,
        Frontiers of Pandora is an entirely standalone adventure with only minor
        references to the events of the films and, thankfully, not a single
        utterance of the word “unobtainium” – at least, not that I can recall.

      <p>
        Even so, its overall story arc doesn’t stray too far from the
        established series formula. Humanity’s colonising Resource Development
        Administration, or RDA, is an oppressive force in the Western Frontier
        with its numerous mining facilities. It’s up to us, playing as an
        unnamed Na’vi raised in captivity, to unite the three isolated Na’vi
        clans in the region and make a stand against invaders hellbent on doing
        more damage to the natural habitat than actor Sam Worthington has done
        to the American accent.
        <br /><br />
        Broadly speaking, I was happy to step into the Kevin Durant-sized feet
        of the eco warrior spearheading the uprising, and there were some pretty
        heavy moments along the way that brought some real weight to the
        conflict, but I can’t say that I ever became particularly bonded with
        any one character in Frontiers of Pandora. A big part of the reason I
        never felt too invested in the individual plights of the countless Na’vi
        clan members I met over the course of the journey is that they’re
        largely indistinguishable from each other in looks and have
        exotic-sounding monikers that are easily mixed up in my middle-aged
        memory. I can barely keep track of the names of my kids’ best friends,
        let alone be relied upon to discern the difference between one character
        called Eetu and another called Etuwa. Star Wars has its fair share of
        silly names too, but it’s also rich with countless different races, and
        personally I have a better chance of putting a name to a face when one
        face is green and the other has three pairs of eyes.
      </p>

        The closest I came to encountering a traditional boss was at the very

        that set off a chain reaction of explosions around them.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Furthermore, Frontiers of Pandora’s two main antagonists, RDA bad guy
        businessman John Mercer and his head of military muscle, General Angela
        Harding, barely have a presence for the bulk of the campaign. Instead,
        they’re mainly encountered via sporadic video communications, as though
        there’s been an outbreak of cat-person COVID and they’ve been left with
        no choice but to taunt you via Zoom calls. Neither are ever really
        confronted in a physical sense, and their fates effectively remain
        undetermined as of the end of the story – which left me feeling slightly
        underwhelmed as the credits rolled. It perhaps wouldn’t have been so bad
        had there been other high-ranking nasties to focus my attention on, but
        there’s a surprising absence of boss fights in Frontiers of Pandora. In
        fact, the closest I came to encountering a traditional boss was at the
        very end, and they died instantly when I fired a rocket into a gas
        canister that set off a chain reaction of explosions around them. That
        made for a slightly silly way to round out an otherwise mostly serious
        story.
        <br /><br />
        Dances with Viperwolves
        <br /><br />
        The Western Frontier itself, though, is truly remarkable. Frontiers of
        Pandora provides some genuinely breathtaking environments to explore,
        and thanks to the hyper-agility of your Na’vi character it’s a real joy
        to experience at speed. A responsive set of controls allow you to
        sprint, slide, and soar through the air with charged-up lunges, and
        there are plenty of environmental aids on hand to enhance your mobility.
        Namely, large leaves launch you across long distances and dangling vines
        can zip you up to the forest canopy in an instant. It’s exhilarating to
        whip along the tops of long, twisting branches and through hollowed-out
        logs, huffing the spores of special plants that temporarily boost your
        momentum and transform you into a blue blur that would almost make Sonic
        the Hedgehog turn an envious shade of green.
        <br /><br />
        Frontiers of Pandora’s world certainly feels alive as well, with flowers
        that shyly withdraw into their stems as you pass by and pods that spit
        their seeds when you approach as though you just surprised them with a
        particularly hilarious joke. Because this vibrant ecosystem is so full
        of life, there’s naturally a great deal that can be harvested and killed
        in order to gather the resources required to prepare stat-boosting meals
        and craft mods for your Na’vi weapons and clothing. I enjoyed the
        tactile way you harvest flora by tightening your grip on it with the
        right trigger and swiveling it to the point of least resistance with the
        left thumbstick – it’s the first time I’ve used this sort of mechanic to
        pick fruit instead of locks, and it feels consistently satisfying when a
        piece of fresh produce suddenly pops off the vine.
        <br /><br />
        I didn’t get too deep into the hunting side of Frontiers of Pandora,
        though, and mainly stuck to killing animals in self defense – like the
        snarling packs of viperwolves that regularly disrupted my morning jungle
        jogs. But one look at the Hunter’s Guide in the pause menu reveals a
        lengthy list of potential prey to track down, and although it’s not
        really my style to slaughter space cows, I do at least appreciate the
        thoughtfulness applied to the design of Frontiers of Pandora’s
        ecosystem. Like how if you can kill an animal cleanly with one arrow you
        can claim the best version of its meat for cooking, but on the other
        hand if you use a machine gun it will end up being completely spoiled.
        Similarly, certain fruits yield the most beneficial results for cooking
        if they’re picked at specific times, such as during the day or when it’s
        raining.
        <br /><br />
        Frontiers of Pandora looks amazing when scrutinized up close, but it
        arguably looks at its best when viewed atop an Ikran soaring through the
        skies above it, and once I’d bonded with my winged steed some five hours
        into the story I pretty much chose to travel by air at every opportunity
        I got. Admittedly, piloting the Ikran doesn’t quite nail the awesome
        sense of speed here that it conjures up in the films, but they’re still
        supremely useful for wiping out smaller RDA installations from above,
        and it really can’t be understated how consistently exhilarating it is
        to leap off a cliff’s edge and plummet towards terminal velocity, only
        to tap a button and have your loyal Ikran swoop in to catch you and
        carry you to safety on its back.
        <br /><br />
        It’s therefore a little strange, then, that regular, old-fashioned
        ground mounts aren’t introduced to the story until after you’ve been
        given access to their flying equivalent, and it meant that I rode one of
        Pandora’s direhorses precisely once as part of the tutorial mission that
        greeted me upon my arrival in its Upper Plains region, and then never
        felt the need to saddle one ever again. After all, why steer an alien
        horse around obstacles on the ground when you can issue forth a
        high-pitched yodel to call down your Ikran pal and then just fly over
        them?
        <br /><br />
        Similarly, it is a slight shame that the Clouded Forest, the region in
        which the bulk of the story’s third act takes place, is by far and away
        the least attractive area in the entire Western Frontier. It’s shrouded
        in so much fog that it’s the one part of Frontiers of Pandora that could
        probably run on a Nintendo 64, and while the final hours of the story
        are some of the most spectacular in terms of action, they didn’t leave
        as lasting an impression of my time exploring Pandora as the campaign’s
        more majestic first half.
        <br /><br />
        Blue Murder
        <br /><br />
        Since you’re basically only wearing a loincloth and a snarl, you’re
        pretty vulnerable to the attacks from the human forces that guard every
        RDA installation you’re tasked with taking down, so it’s just as well
        you have both primitive Na’vi tools and high-tech human weaponry at your
        disposal. Collectively, Frontiers of Pandora’s arsenal seems pretty
        limited compared to those featured in Far Cry 6 and Horizon Forbidden
        West, but there’s enough here to get the job done – specifically, I
        relied mostly on the Na’vi longbow for sniping ground troops, the
        assault rifle for shredding aircraft from a distance, and the
        surprisingly overpowered shotgun to reduce the RDA mechs into piles of
        sparking scrap.
        <br /><br />
        More powerful versions of each weapon class can be found hidden
        throughout the world or as rewards for completing side quests, and
        equipping the most optimal gear in your loadout boosts your overall
        combat level in a similar way to Destiny or The Division. In turn, each
        main story mission or side quest is marked with a recommended combat
        level, but in my experience it didn’t seem to pose too much of an
        additional challenge if I went into a mission under-leveled, at least on
        the default difficulty setting. It certainly helped that enemy AI is
        generally pretty dim, and some of the special abilities that you can
        unlock in its skill tree can be easily abused. Once I gained the ability
        to punch through the cockpit glass and tear mech pilots right out of
        their harnesses, I proceeded to forcefully eject each and every one of
        those fools like they were Nickelback CDs mistakenly inserted into my
        car stereo.
        <br /><br />
        Frontiers of Pandora’s final fistful of missions do raise the stakes and
        up the enemy numbers substantially, though, and it made for some
        terrifically tough and tense encounters that left me with elbow-shaped
        grooves in the tops of my knees from leaning closer and closer to my
        television. Yet while I appreciated these more fierce and
        close-quartered forms of firefights against far more heavily armoured
        and agile mechs, there were certain times where I couldn’t be quite sure
        if I was being challenged or simply cheated. In some instances it felt
        like enemies were infinitely respawning, in others it appeared they had
        a supernatural sense of my location at all times, and most
        frustratingly, there were a number of occasions where I was clearly
        being shot through cover.
        <br /><br />
        On the whole, Frontiers of Pandora’s shooting is mostly solid but it
        doesn’t really evolve in any substantial ways over the course of the
        story. It’s nice that you can use your Na’vi sense to spot weak points
        on mechs and potentially take them out with one well-placed shot, and
        being able to craft special ammo like electric-shock rounds for the
        shotgun certainly comes in handy. But it never quite feels as freeform
        as the Far Cry series at its best – as far as I can tell you can’t ever
        use bait to lure the wildlife into an enemy camp in order to cause a
        deadly distraction, for example, and although you can use your
        computer-hacking tool to disable gun turrets and mechs, you can’t seem
        to ever use it to turn those machines against each other. When you
        factor in the fairly limited number of enemy types found throughout, I
        didn’t really feel like I ever had to adjust my approach to each combat
        encounter to any significant degree.

      <h2>New Look Na’vi-gation</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        HUD clutter has long been a concern for many of Ubisoft’s open-world
        adventures, and it was only recently that I found myself struggling to
        spot the desert surroundings of Baghdad in Assassin’s Creed Mirage
        beyond the swarm of obnoxious icons that dotted the landscape in its
        guided mode. To its credit, Frontiers of Pandora has taken a Marie
        Kondo-style clean out to its presentation, and although it took me a
        while to adapt to not having my hand held as much I ultimately found it
        to be a change for the better.
        <br /><br />
        Navigating the world in relies largely on the use of your Na’vi sense,
        which momentarily highlights interactive objects in your surroundings as
        well as the general direction of your currently tracked objective, but
        these highlights quickly fade from view once you release the Na’vi sense
        button and afford you an unimpeded view of the world around you. There
        were occasionally times where I did lament the absence of a minimap,
        like when I found myself running in circles in one of the bigger Na’vi
        camps simply trying to find a weapons trader, but for the most part I
        enjoyed how Frontiers of Pandora’s navigation allowed me to find my own
        way through the world rather than just blindly follow a more strictly
        guided trail.
        <br /><br />
        I just wish there were better rewards for exploring off the beaten
        track, though, because the more I moved around Frontiers of Pandora’s
        expanse the more of the same RDA mining facilities I would stumble upon,
        each requiring similar if not identical methods of crank-turning and
        exhaust vent-shooting in order to sabotage them. In fact, both the main
        story missions and optional RDA installations have you repeatedly
        indulging in sabotage like you’re a blue-skinned Beastie Boy, and
        although it's an impressive effect to see previously polluted areas get
        reclaimed by nature it all starts to feel a bit samey by the end. I can
        get behind the strong environmental message that Frontiers of Pandora
        shares with James Cameron’s films, but this isn’t exactly the sort of
        recycling I had in mind.
      </p>

        Elsewhere, I never found any truly emergent gameplay surprises, and more
        often than not I just found acres of empty space. At one point I spent
        about half an hour touring around a series of floating islands in the
        sky, and all I came away from it with was a piece of fruit and a handful
        of sky moss. That’s a heck of a long way to travel just to collect the
        ingredients for a particularly awful-sounding smoothie, and I can’t
        recall ever leaving so empty-handed from one of Hyrule’s sky islands.
        <br /><br />
        There are plenty of sidequests to find and complete, but beyond the
        practical rewards for doing so in the form of extra resources and skill
        points, there’s just not the same sense of awe or discovery to be found
        compared to the more consistently delightful detours experienced in
        Elden Ring or The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The standard of
        open-world excellence has been raised in recent years, and Frontiers of
        Pandora can’t quite measure up despite how wonderful it all appears at
        first glance. To be fair, it’s a gigantic map and I haven’t covered all
        of it, but the law of averages suggests that if there was some truly
        awesome stuff to find out there I would have found at least some of it
        by now.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora features a stunning alien world to explore
        with a refreshingly uncluttered approach to navigation, countless enemy
        bases to destroy and Na’vi clan sidequests to complete, and no shortage
        of exotic flora and fauna to harvest and hunt. However, its combat is
        pretty one-dimensional, its mission design is a bit on the repetitive
        side, and its environment is generally lacking in any major surprises
        beyond visual splendor, meaning that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a
        solid shooting adventure that’s more inside the box than truly out of
        this world.
