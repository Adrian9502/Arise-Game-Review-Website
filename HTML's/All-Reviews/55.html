      <p>
        Let's get this out of the way: Genshin Impact and its beautiful,
        expansive anime world of Teyvat clearly draw inspiration from The Legend
        of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and I mean a whole heck of a lot. From the
        art style to the stamina-based "climb anything" mechanic to the gliding,
        it’s impossible not to be reminded of Link’s open-world adventures in
        Hyrule while exploring. But this isn't just some copycat, as Genshin
        Impact's fantastical world, wide array of diverse playable characters,
        and deep RPG systems are all unique and awesome enough to let it stand
        on its own two feet – and every one of the more than 120 hours I've
        spent in Teyvat has been an absolute blast.
        <br /><br />
        Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action-adventure RPG where you play a
        vague and mysterious “traveler” from another world who arrives in the
        land of Teyvat before being attacked by a sorceress or God
        or...something, and your twin is captured. After waking up on a beach at
        level one and with zero loot, you set off on a quest to find your lost
        sibling that involves a whole lot of picking fruit, crafting items, and
        fighting deities, but surprisingly little in the way of actually
        searching for your twin. Because, just like during Link's rush to save
        Zelda, completing these quests where you *checks notes* feed ducks is
        way more important.
        <br /><br />
        Genshin Impact’s story is one of its weaker points, using just about
        every anime character trope and story cliche in the book. Characters
        will re-explain the same magical jargon like they’re getting paid by the
        word, and the story meanders from one amusing misadventure to another
        with little cohesion. That poor pacing certainly isn’t helped by the
        XP-gating that happens between each act, where you’ll need to hit an
        increasingly more difficult to reach Adventurer Rank to advance to the
        next quest.
        <br /><br />
        But since you'll spend most of your time roaming the world and making
        your own stories as you rank up instead of listening to people explain
        whatever the heck an Anemoculus is, that messy structure isn't a
        dealbreaker. And, with a few exceptions, the cast of quirky characters
        (a whopping 23 of which are playable) are a lot of fun to interact with
        and play as, even if I occasionally rolled my eyes when they made
        repeated and very uncalled for horny comments for no reason at all –
        yay, anime.
      </p>
      <h2>Teyvat Traveler</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The real star here is Teyvat itself, a world that is absolutely bursting
        at the seams with possibilities. Every nook and cranny is loaded with
        collectibles to power your characters up with, chests to discover and
        pull loot from, puzzles to solve, enemies to take down, challenges to
        complete, dungeons to tackle, relentless bosses to fight, and quests to
        pursue. It’s actually almost distressing how much there is to do. In any
        given area in the massive world map, there always seemed to be about
        five or more things in my immediate field of view to pursue, each with
        their own challenges and rewards. Sometimes it's difficult just to stay
        on task and complete major quests simply because there’s such an
        embarrassment of riches available to you as you explore the world. A
        locked chest that catches the corner of your eye might lead to an
        impromptu quest or multi-step puzzle. Following a fluttering blue fairy
        might lead to a massive combat encounter or even a lengthy boss fight.
        It’s a disgustingly addictive chain reaction of things to do in the best
        possible way.
        <br /><br />
        Teyvat is a world absolutely bursting at the seams with things to do.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn’t hurt that the world of Teyvat is absolutely gorgeous to look
        at and listen to throughout, with the notable exception of some
        occasional obligatory over-the-top anime voice acting. Although it
        borrows more than it invents in terms of presentation, the sights and
        sounds of this world are still a joy to behold, with breathtaking vistas
        around every corner and a memorable soundtrack to back them up. On the
        PS4 and mobile, sometimes you’ll fast travel into an area before it
        finishes loading and have to wait for the world to catch up with you,
        but aside from those occasional hiccups, Genshin Impact looks and
        performs remarkably well.
        <br /><br />
        Once you start unlocking new characters, each with their own fighting
        style, abilities, and elemental affinities, the world takes on different
        shapes as you gain completely new ways of interacting with it. What was
        once a lake too vast for you to swim across becomes easily traversable
        with the help of a cryo-type character like Kaeya that can simply freeze
        the water. Mountain peaks once too steep to climb become simple to reach
        once you unlock Venti and his ability to create wind currents wherever
        he pleases. Just when I thought I understood what my time in Teyvat was
        going to look like, I unlocked a new character, item, or ability that
        completely changed the way I played and reinvigorated my excitement for
        the next dozen hours of obsessive loot chasing.
        <br /><br />
        Combat revolves around instantly switching between a party of up to four
        characters to shoot, hack, and explode through a broad assortment of
        enemy types. Each character comes equipped with their own elemental type
        and a few abilities that utilize that element. By switching between
        characters and using their powers synergistically you can unleash some
        seriously effective combinations. For example, if you use Xingqui’s
        water abilities to get the enemy wet, then follow up with Fischl’s
        electric attack, damage is multiplied and can wipe out a boatload of
        baddies in one go.
        <br /><br />
        Instantly switching characters to synergize powers can enable some
        serious combos.
        <br /><br />
        Filling out your roster of playable characters, weapons, and items, and
        discovering the ways in which they interact with one another becomes
        vital to your combat efficiency, especially for certain challenges that
        require you to finish the encounter before a timer runs out. This
        becomes particularly important as you approach the current endgame and
        enemies become more dangerous and gain beefy health bars, especially
        bosses. Whether you’re fighting a giant wolf who ruins your day with ice
        attacks that are just plain mean or taking on a flaming plant with some
        truly disgusting inferno abilities, using every tool at your disposal
        becomes indispensable.
        <br /><br />
        Genshin Impact can also be played co-op after reaching Adventure Rank
        16, but at the moment this feature feels pretty tacked on. You can host
        or join another player to tackle challenges and take down bosses
        together, but in the vast majority of cases the guest is unable to reap
        the rewards from any activities you complete. That's too bad, because
        adventuring with a friend can actually be a lot of fun – but when one of
        you is locked out of nearly all loot and progression, merely able to
        help out in combat, it’s just not rewarding enough to do for more than a
        short time.
      </p>
      <h2>Microtransactions and its "Gacha" Model</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Genshin Impact is entirely free, but the elephant in the room is its
        “gacha” model – also known as loot boxes – that tempts you to spend both
        in-game currency and real money on randomized characters, loot,
        consumables, and more. The ecosystem certainly flirts with being
        pay-to-win (a slightly less meaningful issue in a game with a focus on
        single-player and no PvP), but manages to strike a decent balance so
        that those who don't want to spend a dime can still enjoy the whole game
        for free.
        <br /><br />
        While it’s true that all the most powerful characters and weapons can
        immediately be acquired by investing enough money into loot boxes, they
        can technically be unlocked by getting lucky with the free currency
        provided as well – or if, like me, you manage to play over 120 hours in
        two weeks without paying anything at all and grind them out through
        sheer persistence. But more importantly, those powerful weapons and
        characters are by no means a requirement to advance, and I found myself
        breezing through most challenges through skill and grinding alone until
        I finally got lucky with some formidable unlocks that made the going
        much easier.
        <br /><br />
        The real trouble with the gacha model comes in the later stages of
        progression, when the grind for account-wide “adventure XP” and upgrade
        materials becomes an exponentially steeper climb and time-gated
        activities that reward those things become a massive progression
        roadblock… which can be lifted for the right price, of course. This
        means that those willing to shell out some money are able to advance
        through the endgame much faster than non-paying players, who will have
        to play a heck of a lot more to catch up. In fact, just about every item
        in Genshin Impact can be acquired with enough help from your wallet, and
        anytime you run up against one of these barriers, you can be sure a
        pop-up will come to remind you exactly how you can overcome it.
        Admittedly it took about 40-50 hours of play before that wall really
        started to loom in front of me, but once it hits progression can slow
        substantially.
        <br /><br />
        The good news is that I still enjoyed almost every part of Genshin
        Impact’s grind, even after more than 100 hours. The gameplay loop of
        exploring the world, solving puzzles, beating up baddies, completing
        quests, and unlocking new characters and equipment to upgrade and
        experiment with is incredibly addictive. Even in later stages when
        lucrative quests dry up and you’re left to wander Teyvat solving puzzles
        and finding hidden chests for slivers of XP and loot, it’s hard to
        complain when all of that is still a ton of fun. Even if the temptation
        to pull out your credit card is ever-present and sometimes in your face,
        the grind (so far) hasn’t been unpleasant enough to make the experience
        painful for me as a free player.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Genshin Impact is an amazing open-world adventure that draws heavily on
        both its Breath of the Wild and anime inspirations to create something
        truly special. Even if the gacha model introduces some undesirable level
        grinding deeper in, the excellent combat, addictive exploration, and
        beautiful world make this one of the most exciting games I've played all
        year.
