      <span class="author"> BY KYLE HILLIARD </span>
      <p>
        The Call of Duty franchise is no stranger to mobile gaming, but the
        succinctly titled Call of Duty: Mobile is different. While I’ve already
        fought Call of Duty zombies on a phone and even used a Nintendo DS
        stylus to aim down sights (I don’t recommend it) in unambitious games
        designed for the limitations of their platforms, this new entry
        represents a concerted effort from Activision to make a mark on the
        notoriously difficult-to-crack and overcrowded mobile market – and it
        clearly wants to bring in people for the long term. You won’t find a
        campaign, but the multiplayer modes are substantial and even include a
        full battle royale. What’s put forth is impressive, but the controls are
        iffy and its free-to-play nature has it reminding you about its
        microtransactions often, even if they are thankfully easy to ignore.
        <br /><br />
        Using a touch screen to control a shooter will never be on par with a
        controller, much less a keyboard and mouse, and you simply cannot avoid
        that. Aside from the inherent relative lack of speed and precision,
        you’re also covering up part of the screen with your fingers. With those
        understandings in place, however, I can say I had a decent time moving
        and firing in Call of Duty: Mobile. Movement can be somewhat
        inconsistent with the virtual left control stick, but aiming and firing
        feels generally okay. Sneaking up on someone and lining up the reticle
        works, and in the reverse scenario I was able to get my gun up and fire
        back quickly and in a reliable way. More detailed movement, like
        vaulting through a window, crouching behind cover, and tossing off a
        grenade are trickier, thanks to the density of on-screen icons, but
        standard shooting is satisfying. It exceeded my admittedly low
        expectations, but that’s not saying much.
        <br /><br />
        That overabundance of icons is arguably the biggest barrier to
        comfortably controlling your soldier. There are 20 buttons hovering
        around at all times in standard multiplayer (not including the virtual
        control sticks), and even more in battle royale. It makes the interface
        ugly, busy, and hard to get a handle on, but I’m also not really sure
        there is a better way when using a controller isn’t an option. And,
        bizarrely, it’s not: despite both Android and iOS now being capable of
        using standard Bluetooth controllers (like PS4 controllers or a newer
        Xbox One controller), neither version of Call of Duty: Mobile officially
        offers support, which is just confusing.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Despite Android and iOS both supporting Bluetooth controllers, Call of
        Duty: Mobile bizarrely doesn't.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Looking past the sea of icons, though, Call of Duty: Mobile looks great
        – again, relatively speaking. The environments, guns, and soldiers are
        all full of surprising detail with character models that don’t look
        pared down for mobile, and plenty of bits of debris all over the
        environment. Naturally, it doesn’t hold up placed side-by-side with Call
        of Duty: Black Ops 4 running on an Xbox One X, but it is impressively
        close on my iPhone XR.
      </p>
      <h2>1 Vs. 100</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The battle royale mode is definitely the most impressive element of Call
        of Duty: Mobile’s package. It plays like a condensed version of Call of
        Duty: Black Ops 4’s Blackout mode with various class options, vehicles,
        and other bells and whistles. You can play in third or first-person (the
        two styles have seperate matchmaking to ensure third-person players
        don’t have an unfair advantage), and I rarely, if ever, ran into
        slowdown or game-breaking bugs. I went in alone in first-person and had
        familiar, intense moments of crouching in a house with my gun aimed at
        the door while the safe zone closed around me. But I also had the fun,
        absurd moments of getting in a helicopter with a group of three
        strangers and crashing it into the side of a mountain. This battle
        royale may have a smaller map with shorter matches compared to its
        peers, but still produces the exciting stories I expect from the genre
        despite that, which impressed me.
        <br /><br />
        The other more traditional Call of Duty multiplayer modes are fun, but
        familiar. Team Deathmatch is straightforward, Domination is all about
        capturing specific zones, Search and Destroy is the most tactical as it
        has you setting and disarming bombs – all of which all you to practice
        against A.I. opponents. I had the most fun with Frontline, which is a
        variation on Team Deathmatch that has you spawning from your team’s base
        after every death. It plays like comfortable, familiar Call of Duty and
        having it available on my phone to dive into a match every now and then
        has been enough to convince me I should keep the game installed.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It plays like a condensed version of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4’s
        Blackout mode.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Call of Duty: Mobile is free to play, but outside of a handful of
        typical annoyances related to the model (like reminders that the store
        exists and interesting gun colors being locked behind paywalls), I have
        not found the microtransactions themselves to be overbearing or
        obnoxious. Starting it up prompts you with multiple reminders that you
        can use real money that must be annoyingly dismissed, and unlocking new
        items shows additional items you would have gotten if you had bought the
        $10 premium or $25 elite pass. You can also spend money on points to
        exchange for guns and items, but otherwise spending money is pushed to
        the side just for those who want to do it. Playing normally nets
        frequent upgrades and unlocks, and though the pace of those rewards
        slows as you progress, I remained happy with what I received without
        monetary investment even after dozens of matches.
        <br /><br />
        You earn credits to buy specific weapons just by playing, and you can
        periodically elect to watch ads for small unlocks without spending a
        dime. Alternatively, you can purchase COD Points with real money to
        spend on upgrades, guns, and various cosmetic items. Upgrades unlock new
        attachments for your guns that incrementally improve things like damage
        or accuracy, but most of it just comes down to personal preference, like
        which kind of gun sight you prefer. Because most of the attachments
        upgrade your guns in small ways and matchmaking is effective at grouping
        you with similarly skilled opponents, I never encountered phenomenally
        overpowered players that had an unfair advantage simply by paying their
        way to victory, which is extremely important.
      </p>

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Call of Duty: Mobile represents the best the juggernaut franchise has
        ever been on a handheld platform. The leveling path is rewarding, even
        without spending money, and there are lots of modes to jump around
        between, including an impressive battle royale mode. Unfortunately, it
        is still a shooter controlled by a touch-screen with no bluetooth
        controller support – even though I was impressed, the accuracy and
        usability will still never be as good as its console and PC
        counterparts.
