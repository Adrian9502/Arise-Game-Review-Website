      <p>
        On paper, The Invincible has all the makings of a fun adaptation of a
        classic sci-fi novel into a combat-free adventure game, including space
        exploration, a mysterious threat, and an amnesiac protagonist who is
        doing their best to figure out what exactly is going on the planet of
        Regis III. But while there are points of intrigue in Starward
        Industries' take on Stanislaw Lem’s 1964 story of the same name, there
        are a lot of things that don’t translate well off of the page.
        <br /><br />
        To start, The Invincible doesn’t do a good job of providing much context
        for its story at the outset, which is pretty important for a
        story-focused game. We do learn from the introduction comic that there
        are two rival factions competing against each other in a space race, but
        why they are competing – or even when – is never explained. All we know
        is that the crew of the science vessel Dragonfly arrive at and quickly
        find themselves marooned on Regis III, with our peppy biologist
        protagonist Dr. Yasna alone and with no idea of how she even arrived on
        the planet’s surface.
        <br /><br />
        While amnesia can be a bit of an overused method of storytelling, it
        actually works well within the context of the story in The Invincible.
        Not only is jogging her memory through interacting with objects as she
        searches for her crewmates an interesting way to learn about what
        happened to Yasna in a non-linear format, but it also plays into a major
        element of the story in the later acts that I won’t spoil. There are
        multiple different memories that can be recovered, though they only
        exist to help provide a little more backstory – like how encountering
        water reminds Yasna of the time her boss told her to keep hydrated – and
        aren’t required to progress.
      </p>
      <h2>
        While amnesia can be an overused method of storytelling, it actually
        works well here.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        At first, exploring Regis III is quite an adventure. Not only are you
        seeking answers around the mystery of Yasna’s blackouts and missing
        crewmates, but there’s also something to be said about how awe-inspiring
        everything looks and feels. The first hour of exploring a desert is set
        to epic sci-fi music and colorful backdrops of nearby planets and
        shooting stars, which really pulled me into the beauty of space. On the
        other hand, as The Invincible progresses, it’s clear that not only is
        this grand scenery the highpoint of its sights, but that they are
        directing attention away from some pretty big weaknesses. Pop-in also
        occurs often, regardless of whether you're running around a large or
        enclosed area, and the first-person view can result in motion sickness,
        especially when climbing due to how often and quickly the camera shakes
        around. In general, travel in The Invincible can be pretty frustrating.
        <br /><br />
        Even though the path you're meant to follow is linear, finding the
        correct way to go can still be confusing. While you'll encounter one
        rock formation that is climbable, the exact same-looking rocks can't be
        climbed in the next section of the map. Things like this make the
        overall geography of where you're supposed to go inconsistent.
        <br /><br />
        When you’re able to find the right path, you’ll then be greeted with
        unnecessarily slow climbing animations, which are an aggravating
        replacement for a simple jumping ability. Thankfully, by the time you’re
        climbing structures, you’ll likely already be used to how painfully slow
        the movement in The Invincible is. Yes, I understand that space is
        taxing and that we’d all be struggling to move fast in Yasna's shoes,
        but not being able to sprint for more than five seconds without getting
        tired is painful, especially when around 80 percent of the gameplay is
        based on walking. There is honestly so much pointless walking that I’d
        guess at least two or three hours could have been trimmed off the
        overall 11-hour runtime by either increasing the speed or letting you
        fast-travel a new area – and the pace of the story would have benefited
        from it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        None of the attempts at gameplay outside of putting one foot in front of
        the other are any better.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        So walking isn’t much fun, but none of the attempts at gameplay that are
        made outside of putting one foot in front of the other are any better.
        Whether it’s the “puzzles” that consist of turning a knob to a different
        channel or scanning over the area with a tracker to pinpoint important
        items using a hot-and-cold system, there just isn’t anything interesting
        or challenging about the gameplay aspects of The Invincible. The one
        section where you use a gun also feels completely pointless, as you are
        pretty much just firing it randomly into the sky without any indication
        as to whether it is even doing anything. These mechanics all feel like
        they were added in solely to justify the fact that it is an interactive
        game instead of a visual novel, with none of them adding anything of
        value or enjoyment to the way I experienced the story.
        <br /><br />Alongside these gameplay issues, The Invincible falls into
        the same trap as many story-focused games where the protagonist is alone
        for most of the journey. While Yasna does have her astrogator, Novak, in
        her ear to help guide her throughout the mission, the vast majority of
        her time is spent alone and without much human contact. While it makes
        sense that she wouldn’t come upon others on a remote planet, it just
        made everything feel empty – especially given how literally open and
        empty most of the actual locations are. <br /><br />
        Despite how empty and slow The Invincible can feel at times, its story
        is actually gripping. Yasna is charming, and it’s hard not to root for
        her. It’s clear she knows her stuff, as she can often be heard going off
        on fascinating scientific tangents about something as simple as fish, or
        ruminating on how she wants to help people (even based on the minimal
        interaction she has with people throughout the story). This all comes
        together in the final section, which has a number of different possible
        results that are all based on dialogue decisions you choose in the final
        interaction with a certain character. While the idea of multiple endings
        is a good way to end the story, the majority of them don’t feel
        satisfying. Of the six different endings I was able to discover, they
        all either ended abruptly or felt like some information was left out.
        Every time I expected an epilogue scene to follow after the credits, it
        simply took me right back to the main menu. For all the intrigue that
        led up to it, the end to The Invincible doesn’t feel satisfying, instead
        leaving a bitter aftertaste to an otherwise interesting story by not
        providing any closure or context – which is ironically similar to how
        the entire story starts.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        The Invincible is a prime example of trying to fit a square peg of a
        story into the round hole that is the medium of video games. While the
        premise and story both contain worthwhile parts, the light, pointless
        gameplay built around it could be much better, as it lacks any depth to
        its puzzles and is weighed down by too much tedious walking around
        lifeless locations that feature impressive backdrops but empty
        foregrounds that aren't worth exploring. There’s only so much even a
        likable protagonist like Yasna can do with a story, environment, and
        mechanics that don’t give you much to do until you’re seven hours in. If
        you are looking for an enjoyable sci-fi story about space exploration
        and mystery, your time would likely be better spent simply reading
        Stanislaw Lem's 1964 novel, The Invincible; at least your imagination
        won’t be as limited as this game seems to be.
