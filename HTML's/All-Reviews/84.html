      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        Halo Infinite’s single-player campaign, like a new generation of Master
        Chief’s MJOLNIR armor, powers up a 20-year-old series, by both returning
        to its roots and blazing new trails to build off of. By shifting to an
        open-world map while retaining the classic gameplay both on foot and in
        its iconic vehicles, it offers a level of freedom in combat not seen in
        any prior Halo game. There’s a lot to do in this expansive playground,
        and completing its never-dull-or-overwhelming list of activities earns
        more combat options and, ultimately, more fun. It doesn’t quite
        recapture the environmental variety or memorable story of the original
        trilogy, but it’s still a thrilling return to form for one of gaming’s
        most beloved series, and for Master Chief himself.
      </p>
      <h2>It’s Got a Nice Ring to it</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The change from the traditional linear series of combat arenas to
        letting you freely explore the Zeta Halo ring where Infinite takes place
        marks the first time developer 343 Industries has broken from the
        blueprint that Bungie drew 20 years ago. All of that space proves to be
        a natural fit for what’s always been a sort of sandbox-style shooter at
        heart, where unexpected things happen. In Infinite, that same thing is
        true on a grander scale.
        <br /><br />
        But you aren’t dropped straight onto the ring and set loose. Instead,
        the first couple of the 25 hours I spent completing it on Heroic
        difficulty take place indoors, and that intro works well as a way to get
        acquainted with Halo’s literal new gameplay hook, the Grappleshot, as
        well as the first of many delightfully challenging bosses.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Infinite’s moment-to-moment gameplay feels most like a cross between
        Halo 1 and Halo 3.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And sure, the Grappleshot might feel quite familiar if you’ve played
        games like Just Cause or Titanfall, but it feels right at home in Halo.
        This fantastic tool can be used to grab weapons from afar, escape dire
        combat encounters when your depleted shields are screaming at you for a
        recharge, or launch you directly into the bad guys for a finishing melee
        attack with your full weight behind it. It’s a natural extension of the
        equipment idea introduced in Halo 3 – and that’s part of why Infinite’s
        moment-to-moment gameplay feels most like a cross between Halo 1 and
        Halo 3, which is very much a good thing.
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, the bosses make up many of Infinite’s best encounters,
        excluding those that you organically create for yourself out in Zeta
        Halo’s sandbox. The first, against the Banished Brute lieutenant
        Tremonius, showcases extra-challenging AI that will require you to keep
        your wits about you, not just extra ammo in your back pocket. He uses a
        jetpack as well as a lightning-quick ground-pound attack that will rock
        you if you’re not ready for it. It’s your first indication that each
        boss fight will keep you on your toes, and in total, Infinite features
        Halo’s best implementation of them yet.
      </p>
      <h2>Infinite features Halo’s best implementation of boss fights yet.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This warm-up serves as ample prep for the open world, and when you get
        out there, that’s when the Halo 1 feeling kicks in. You’ll need to get
        around on foot at first, and thus learning to grapple onto trees or into
        the ground ahead of you to propel yourself onward becomes the most fun
        way to navigate the world. You’ll encounter all sorts of opportunities
        to get into trouble on Zeta Halo, from rescuing groups of captured UNSC
        Marines to taking down propaganda radio towers to infiltrating massive
        Banished strongholds to reclaiming UNSC Forward Operating Bases (FOBs).
        While there’s nothing that feels wholly original here relative to games
        like Far Cry or Just Cause, the feature fits Halo in a very natural way,
        and the tasks are both varied enough and not so frequently repeated as
        to ever feel monotonous or annoying.
        <br /><br />
        But, in the grand tradition of Grand Theft Auto 3, you can’t go
        everywhere straight off the bat. Instead, Zeta Halo unlocks section by
        section, with key story missions opening up new lands to explore –
        though I do wish those new lands had a bit more variety. Or really, any
        variety at all. There’s no snowy area like in Combat Evolved, no urban
        area like in Halo 2 (or in Infinite’s own multiplayer maps like Streets
        and Bazaar, for that matter), or really… anything other than the mix of
        forest and stone monoliths. It’s as if 343 didn’t take its artistic
        inspiration from the whole of Halo 1, it took it specifically from “The
        Silent Cartographer” and nowhere else. That’s a bit disappointing,
        especially after a couple dozen hours.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It’s as if 343 took inspiration specifically from “The Silent

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        On a related note, I also wish Zeta Halo was a bit prettier. Halo games,
        like many major first-party efforts, have often been graphical showcases
        for their respective consoles – including 343’s own Halo 4, which
        elicited a late-in-the-generation “How did they do this on the 360?”
        kind of reaction to its gorgeous graphics back in 2012. While Infinite’s
        indoor spaces did wow me at times and there are certainly some
        impressive vistas across its outdoor landscape, Infinite looks perfectly
        good at best, but not jaw-droppingly so as Halo 1, Halo 2, and Halo 4
        did before it.
      </p>
      <h2>“Hey Cortana, What the Hell Is Going on in Halo?”</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Speaking of previous Halo games, the only concern I had heading into
        Halo Infinite that I really had to worry about was the story. Halo 4
        certainly has its issues, but its focus on Master Chief’s relationship
        with a Cortana who was rapidly succumbing to rampancy gave it a
        memorable and commendable emotional core. Halo 5, unfortunately,
        followed up by derailing any momentum that 4 had built by, among other
        narrative crimes, barely letting you play as Master Chief. It dug a deep
        hole for Halo Infinite to try and climb out of – particularly given that
        Infinite tries to both tie up 5’s loose ends and keep the existing
        storyline going, while also serving as the aforementioned “spiritual
        reboot” meant to welcome in new fans. In the end, it’s too tall a task.
        <br /><br />
        It’s not a Halo 5-level disaster by any stretch – for starters, Infinite
        doesn’t waste time with any playable characters who aren’t Master Chief
        – but it probably isn’t going to really make most players happy. Its
        tale focuses on the splinter Covenant faction The Banished (last seen in
        Halo Wars 2) and was not particularly satisfying for this longtime Halo
        fan, and the new players Infinite is hoping to bring in might be
        outright lost. If you’re in the latter group, you’re going to ask the
        following questions (and plenty of others) that Infinite never answers:
        Who are the Covenant? Why is Cortana evil? What are the Guardians? None
        of that old ground is covered.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Infinite doesn’t waste time with any playable characters who aren’t
        Master Chief.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And even if, like me, you’ve played every Halo campaign multiple times,
        the fact is that it’s been six years and the last one was the most
        convoluted Halo story ever means that it’s not easy to get comfortable
        with Infinite’s plot. This sixth Halo should’ve come with a “Halo’s
        Story So Far” cinematic that rolls before you start playing, as we’ve
        seen other long-running series do (most recently, Microsoft’s own
        Psychonauts 2). Maybe 343 ran out of time or maybe it never came up, but
        it’s a failure that could’ve been avoided.
        <br /><br />
        Still, there are really good aspects of the story too: namely, the
        relationship between Master Chief and his new AI companion, who we only
        know as The Weapon. She is voiced by Jen Taylor, who also stars as
        Cortana as well as Spartan program creator Dr. Catherine Halsey. You
        don’t need to be a hardcore Halo fan to recognize Taylor’s nuanced
        performances in playing three similar but distinct roles; she
        effortlessly separates the three, playing brilliantly off of the fact
        that The Weapon doesn’t know the Chief at all (though that makes it even
        stranger that basic Halo concepts aren’t spelled out for new players by
        using her as their proxy). We get to watch their partnership be born,
        then strain, and later strengthen. They get sarcastic with each other,
        they argue, and they build an unsteady alliance. Steve Downes,
        meanwhile, is fantastic in his sixth turn as Master Chief, who
        psychologically struggles through Infinite as an emotionally broken and
        lost man who blames himself for the sad state of humanity – the details
        of which are made painfully clear over the course of the campaign. I
        truly hope 343 never recasts either of these two wonderful voice actors.
      </p>
      <h2>Combat Evolved</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Getting back to gameplay, the FOBs are the real key to everything in
        Infinite’s open world. Recapture them and your map will populate with
        many of the aforementioned activities, along with other notable map
        icons like Spartan Core locations – the bounties of which allow you to
        upgrade your equipment in ways that let you tailor your playstyle. I
        pumped all of my points into the Shield Core at first, which made the
        bit of extra punishment that Heroic difficulty doles out feel plenty
        manageable. (If you’re going to tackle Legendary, I’d highly suggest
        this strategy.) The Grappleshot can be upgraded to add a paralyzing
        electric shock attack, boosting the Thruster will let you go invisible
        for a short time when you dash, and maxing out the Drop Wall gives you
        your own protective electric fence. I prioritized them in that order,
        ending with everything maxed out aside from two missing upgrades on the
        Drop Wall, and not only did the equipment add variety to how I handled
        abolishing the Banished, but many of the key boss fights cry out for one
        of them or another. (Thankfully, Infinite is never too heavy-handed
        about suggesting which one is best for each battle.)
        <br /><br />
        Completing the open-world activities also earns you Valor points, which
        do you the big favor of unlocking additional weapons and vehicles you
        can instantly summon from reclaimed FOBs. (Usefully, you’re also able to
        fast travel to any FOB you’ve unlocked.) This became vital – not to
        mention extremely fun – as I approached the 15 optional High-Value
        Targets (HVTs) scattered around the ring. For instance, one HVT – well,
        technically two – is a pair of heavy-hitting Hunters who are flanked by
        a legion of supporting Banished (along with some mid-battle surprises).
        I surveyed that scene, saw the challenge I was up against, then
        fast-traveled back to the closest FOB so that I could order up a shiny
        new Scorpion tank I’d unlocked access to, and then slowly rolled back to
        the HVT Hunters’ turf, trained my tank turret on them one at a time, and
        gleefully eliminated them. Even these heavier vehicles aren’t “I win”
        buttons, though, as bad guys on higher difficulties will quickly and
        repeatedly disable your vehicle with Shock Rifle blasts, often forcing
        you to try another strategy.
      </p>
      <h2>Vehicles have never felt more vital.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This kind of freedom to fight how you want has always been a
        foundational component of Halo’s gameplay, but it arguably started
        diminishing after Halo 3 in favor of more structured battles with a slim
        choice of weapons. Infinite recaptures that signature freeform action in
        a big, fun way thanks to the diversity of locations and the ability to
        approach them from any angle and with any gear. Battles take place
        everywhere: in rivers, indoors,” in midair, and you’ll even have to
        fight uphill in scraps that feel like early 20th-century wars of
        attrition in the Halo universe (particularly on Heroic or Legendary
        difficulty). That encouraged me to use lots of the huge Halo arsenal
        rather than simply falling in love with one weapon (which would’ve been
        the trusty Battle Rifle, of course) for the entire campaign. Sometimes
        I’d want a charged-up Ravager plasma grenade launcher to stop charging
        Brutes in their tracks, other times a scoped weapon might be best for
        quickly headshotting Elites to drop their shields, and Grunts… well,
        they’re still hilariously pathetic (mostly), though Infinite offers more
        ways to blow them up than ever thanks to new attachments on their backs.
        <br /><br />
        Vehicles, meanwhile, are of particular importance in a Halo where you
        can wander all over the entire ring. The Mongoose is the first ride
        you’ll unlock, though without a co-op buddy, its only real purpose is
        zipping from point A to point B faster than you could run. But once you
        get into the meat of the campaign, you can call in a Warthog at a FOB,
        load it up with well-armed Marines, and stroll right up to a Banished
        stronghold and take out as many bad guys as you can from the perimeter
        before heading in. Or you can bring the Wasp in from above, clearing out
        significant numbers of Banished from the relative safety of the sky.
        Thanks to the large scale, vehicles have never felt more vital in Halo,
        which is probably the biggest compliment I can give because they’ve
        always been a high point of this series.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Halo has meant a lot to me over the past 20 years. From first landing on
        the ring in Halo 1 to the surprise Arbiter arc in Halo 2 to being
        heartbroken by Halo 5’s abysmal storytelling, it’s one of the few series
        in gaming where every new mainline entry really matters to me. After six
        years, it was fair to wonder: did Halo still belong in the “Best
        Shooter” conversation? And would I still care about it? I am both
        relieved and delighted that Halo Infinite emphatically answers both
        questions with a resounding yes. Turning us loose to explore a massive
        open ring with almost complete freedom to approach combat with a wide
        range of iconic guns, vehicles, and toys has absolutely brought Halo’s
        single-player campaign back into contention as one of the finest out
        there (to say nothing of the amazing multiplayer suite), and even though
        it drops the ball a bit with the story and lack of environmental
        variety, Infinite picks it back up again with style.
