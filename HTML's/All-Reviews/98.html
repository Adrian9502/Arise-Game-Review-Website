      BY BEN VOLLMER

    <p>
      It’s tempting to view Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. franchise as one of a kind. But recently, other games have attempted to capture that same accessible blend of platforming and fighting. If you enjoy Smash Bros. gameplay, but for some reason dislike Nintendo characters, you have options. Originally released in 2017, following a beta in 2015, Brawlhalla remains the alternative platform fighter with perhaps the most staying power. The free-to-play game sports a unique and approachable, if unpolished, set of fighting mechanics that appeals to even veteran Smash fans. Nintendo Switch owners should still stick to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as that game doesn’t lock the bulk of its content behind paywalls. However, as a crossplay-friendly console, mobile, and PC game, Brawlhalla is the platform fighter for the rest of us.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Run, Jump, and Fight
    </h2>
    <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
    <p>
      From indie games like Brawlout, Rivals of Aether, and Shovel Knight Showdown, to the conceptually interesting (if now forgotten) Sony mascot counterpart PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, a platform fighter is really just a nicer way of saying a Super Smash Bros. clone. Other fighting games lock opponents into a rigid arena, whether it’s the 2D plane of Street Fighter or Tekken’s 3D circular battlefield. The depth in those games comes from mastering each character’s complex moveset.
      <br><br>
      Characters in platform fighters tend to have simpler movesets (you won’t be doing any fireball or dragon punch motions), which gives them a reputation for being more casual. However, they also give players far more expressive movement options, akin to running and jumping in 2D platformers. The stages feature platforms that encourage a more kinetic playstyle. Instead of whittling down health bars, you defeat opponents by knocking them out of the arena, sumo-style. The more damage you take, the easier you become to knock out. 
      <br><br>
      All of this is true in Brawlhalla, and as a longtime Smash Bros. devotee, I immediately clicked with its fundamental combat mechanics. You have a light attack and heavy attack that change depending on direction. There are no grabs, outside of character-specific command grabs, but you do have a brief shield that transitions into a dodge.
      <br><br>
      However, Brawlhalla also introduces twists that should fascinate fellow fans of this fighting subgenre. You have three jumps, as well as endless wall jumps, which give you many flexible options for recovering after being knocked out. The most reliable way to score a kill is by just demolishing an opponent with one strong attack. Instead of Smash’s damage percentage counter, Brawlhalla color codes each fighter’s icon to display how vulnerable they are to being knocked out of the arena.
      <br><br>
      Brawlhalla’s item system sits somewhere between Smash’s wacky, random power-ups and a balanced weapons fighter in the vein of Samurai Shodown or Soul Calibur. Weapon icons frequently spawn on the battlefield, and by picking them up you’ll gain one of two potential weapons determined by your character. Special attacks from these axes, swords, and guns entirely change your moveset. Without a weapon, everyone has the same fast, but short-ranged punches and kicks. Weapons give you vital variety in your attack options. Sometimes, the smartest thing to do is toss your weapon at your foe. Other random projectiles include bombs and spike balls. 
      <br><br>
      Overall, the system could still use a bit more depth, particularly in making characters feel more distinct, but it’s far from brainless. I quickly stumbled across some promising combos and techniques. For instance, a short-range strike pops opponents up into the perfect angle to get sniped in the air with an arrow. The fighting feels unique enough compared to Smash Bros. to justify its existence. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Melee Modes
    </h2>
    <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
    <p>
      Like any good party game, Brawlhalla features local play for you and friends. Up to eight players can join the fracas. Other offline modes include training and tutorials, as well as tournaments against challenging computer opponents.
      <br><br>
      Once you’re ready to take on the world, enter Brawlhalla's online multiplayer modes. You can quickly jump into casual free-for-all or team matches or test experimental changes, similar to Overwatch's test server. Ranked play pits you against serious, competitive players. I never stood a chance, and I couldn’t blame my losses on poor connections because I didn’t experience much lag, unlike certain matches in Smash Bros. Granted, the looser feel of these games doesn’t require precise timing and frame counting like in other fighting games. 
      <br><br>
      You can create custom game rooms for you and friends. Brawlhalla also mixes things up with a new limited game with a quirky gimmick each week. Platform King forces you to move to the correct platform and earn points. Another mode has players trapping the opposing team in bubbles. Even before Ubisoft acquired the developers at Blue Mammoth Games, Brawlhalla played a bit like a modern Rayman game, so I was also happy to see Rayman Legends’ chaotic melee soccer minigame Kung Foot make a return alongside a playable Rayman.  
    </p>
    <h2>
      Everyone Is Here (For a Price)
    </h2>
    <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
    <p>
      Brawlhalla’s fighting mechanics serve as the addictive base every free-to-play game needs to entice players to spend money. Unfortunately, you will have to spend money, either as one-off store purchases or as part of a battle pass subscription, to unlock the bulk of Brawlhalla’s content.
      <br><br>
      Brawlhalla’s continuously expanding roster has dozens of characters, including guest star costumes like Steven Universe, Hellboy, and real-life wrestler Xavier Woods. Characters aren’t cosmetics, they’re the core of a fighting game. You need to test lots of characters to learn who you like, and to learn how to play against others. 
      <br><br>
      However, aside from training modes, you’ll need to drop cash, or do a lot of grinding, to get a roster larger than the measly initial rotation. The same goes for emotes, weapon skins, KO effects, and more. It makes the absolutely massive Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with its tagline of “Everyone Is Here,” seem even more generous. I recommend just buying the one-time $20 pass to unlock every present and future character. 
      </p>
      <h2>
        A Brawl For All
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
      <p>
        Brawlhalla sports a flat cartoony art style that sometimes looks like a Flash game, but at least it has a lot of color and personality. I’ve always wanted a Smash Bros. game that used sprites instead of polygonal models, and this is the closest thing outside of fan projects.
        <br><br>
        The downside is that aside from the handful of recognizable mascots (Lara Croft, Shovel Knight), the somewhat generic, MOBA-ish fantasy characters tend to blur together in the heat of battle. They all have generally the same chibi proportions and share many of the same weapons. I found myself becoming detached from fights I couldn’t fully follow or get invested in. Ironically, I gained sympathy for people who voiced similar criticisms about Smash Bros. Brawlhalla’s bland stages also left me disappointed. Forget Smash Bros.' bustling battlefields ripped from other games. These stages as generic as the characters, but with none of the charm. Their pedestrian layouts, while competitively balanced, do little to amp up the excitement.
        <br><br>
        The good news is that Brawlhalla’s simple visuals allow it to run at a smooth 60 frames per second even on my old HP Envy 17 laptop. Aside from the PC version, the game is available on consoles and mobile phones. Even better, crossplay lets everyone compete together, although I found using a controller to be far superior to using a touch screen or mouse and keyboard. This also isn't the kind of fighting game you want to play with a fight stick. You can’t even adjust graphic settings, because there’s nothing really to adjust. You can at least customize the controls.  
      </p>
      <h2>
        Brother From Another Super Smash Mother
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
      <p>
        At fighting game tournaments, you have your main tournaments, with big popular games that draw in crowds, and your side tournaments, with smaller and less recognizable games that still deserve a shot. If Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a main tournament game, Brawlhalla makes for a fun and worthy side tournament. It’s just too bad you’ll spend all your winnings unlocking its full potential.
