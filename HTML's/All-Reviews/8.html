      <p>
        In light of the high-quality remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 released
        in 2019 and 2020, it felt like a safe bet that Capcom would do an
        equally admirable job of rebuilding Resident Evil 4. Even so, when I hit
        the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror
        game I wasn’t prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out
        from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension
        and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups
        the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside
        setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to
        the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have
        been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting
        mechanics to really shine. I’ve been waiting 18 years for a game to
        thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this
        whole time I’ve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4.
        <br /><br />
        The original Resident Evil 4 is a landmark installment in Capcom’s
        seminal survival-horror series that, for many, would need no
        introduction. However, considering it came out back when we assumed that
        Episode III would be the last Star Wars film and iPhones didn’t even
        exist yet, I should probably give it some context. At the time it was a
        big deal for Resident Evil to switch from the series’ traditional
        fixed-camera perspectives to a then radical over-the-shoulder viewpoint
        that brought us uncomfortably close to the gore and put the emphasis on
        reflexes and precision targeting, and as a result Resident Evil 4 was an
        action-horror epic without peer. Its influence has subsequently been
        felt in countless other third-person classics like Gears of War, Dead
        Space, and The Last of Us, and now its original DNA has been extracted,
        synthesised, and injected into a state-of-the-art host game, mutating it
        into a menacing new monster that's breathtaking to behold and immensely
        intimidating to encounter.
        <br /><br />
        In preparation for this review I returned to the original game for the
        first time in years and was shocked at how badly this remake was needed.
        The movement of main star Leon Kennedy felt ridiculously restricted; he
        struggles to get around as though he’s wearing an old pair of skinny
        jeans that haven’t fit him since his police academy days, and is
        immobilised anytime he gets his gun out as though he’s incapable of
        independent control over his hands and feet at the same time. By modern
        standards it’s absurd, and would absolutely put off a lot of newcomers
        before they could begin to understand why this game is so highly
        regarded.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thankfully, those days are gone. Not unlike the recent Metroid Prime
        Remastered, this Resident Evil 4 remake plays like a 2023 game. Luxuries
        like simultaneous twin-stick movement and targeting mean that you can
        cautiously back away while still keeping your gun trained on the
        advancing hordes, or side-step out of the way of an incoming crossbow
        bolt without having to remove your eye from the scope of your rifle.
        This newfound freedom of movement makes you better equipped to really
        make the most of the immensely satisfying area-specific damage effects;
        blowing kneecaps out to expose an enemy to a melee finisher, blasting
        sticks of dynamite held in the hands of attackers before they have a
        chance to throw them, or simply reveling in some of the grisliest
        headshots in the history of video game shotguns.
      </p>

        Resident Evil 4's original DNA has been extracted, synthesised, and
        injected into a state-of-the-art host game, mutating it into a menacing
        new monster.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        None of this will shock you if you never played the original, but trust
        me, it’s a big deal to those of us who are back for round two: the rough
        edges of a number of other interactions have been filed down, like how
        crates and barrels can be quickly smashed at the tap of a button rather
        than having to clumsily line up a knife swing, making it much faster to
        scramble for ammo and health pickups in the heat of a battle. Weapon
        switching is now performed instantly with a tap of the D-pad rather than
        having to pause to hop in and out of the inventory screen, and Leon’s
        combat knife can also be used to parry enemy attacks or bring a swift
        finish to staggered foes, or to take enemies out silently after he’s
        crept up on them with his new ability to crouch. (It must be those
        looser fitting jeans).
        <br /><br />
        Crucially, though, this overhauled control setup makes combat more
        enjoyably fluid without compromising any of the challenge when played on
        the Hardcore setting recommended for returning players. (‘Standard’ and
        ‘Assisted’ modes are included if you want an easier time of it.) The
        added benefits of the knife are balanced by the fact that it takes
        damage with each use, so you can only rely on it sparingly – otherwise
        it will break like a tiny Master Sword and must be repaired at a
        merchant before you can resume stabbing.
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, enemies move in dangerously erratic ways and have a tendency
        to quickly overwhelm in numbers, so you still have to make snap
        decisions when it comes to prioritising targets. They’ve also learnt a
        few cunning new tricks to trip you up with, like the sneaky way the
        homicidal villagers will lay down bear traps in the middle of a fight to
        keep you on your toes while you’re busy flexing your trigger finger.
        Resident Evil 4 may well give you a more expansive toolset to aid Leon’s
        survival, but you still need to keep your wits and reflexes sharp –
        because losing your head amidst a crowd crawling with a murderous
        mind-controlling parasite can swiftly result in Leon literally losing
        his. Thankfully, a new checkpoint save system minimises any arduous
        backtracking from your last manual typewriter save should Leon perish –
        but purists should take note that the unlockable Professional difficulty
        mode removes that safety net if you prefer a more punishing run the next
        time through.
        <br /><br />
        No matter what difficulty you choose, a major strength of Resident Evil
        4 is that enemy types are continually shuffled so that you can never
        really settle into a one-size fits all strategy. Just as you’re
        comfortably pulling off headshots, they start wearing helmets to force
        you to target their legs. Then, once you’ve busted more kneecaps than a
        debt collector, they start coming back to life with deadly whipping
        tendrils sprouting out of their shoulders. Then, when you’ve figured out
        how to take out these terrifying mutations efficiently, you come face to
        face with a seemingly unstoppable waddling tub of nightmare fuel that
        can regenerate every blown off body part like a T-1000 that was
        hand-sculpted by Clive Barker. Resident Evil 4 gives you a growing
        number of guns that all feel great to use, from submachine guns to
        rocket launchers and the especially powerful magnums, and does its
        absolute best to ensure you’re leaving very little in the chamber after
        each frenzied firefight.
        <br /><br />
        I also love how the tactile nature of almost every element in your
        surroundings can be used as a tactical advantage, provided you can think
        fast enough on your feet. The chainsaw attacks from the terrifying,
        sack-hooded Dr. Salvador are just as deadly to Leon as they are to every
        other enemy in the vicinity, so baiting him into lunging at you and then
        steering him into a crowd of his own minions is a great way to thin the
        herd. Meanwhile, dangling oil lanterns can be shot and dropped onto an
        angry mob to set them all ablaze, but they can also be used to ignite
        hapless animals like cows who will rage out of control and scorch
        everyone in their path. When ammunition is always at a premium, it’s
        both practical and ridiculously entertaining to let a flaming hunk of
        hamburger do your dirty work.

      <h2>Spanish Castle Magic</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Many of you under 30 might have no clue what Resident Evil 4 is about:
        it’s perhaps best described as riding a rollercoaster that’s careening
        off the rails to crash through a row of spectacular haunted houses. What
        starts as a fairly straightforward rescue mission, with Leon sent into a
        small Spanish village in search of the US President’s missing daughter
        Ashley, soon hurtles into a heart-stopping series of battles against
        giant sea monsters and towering trolls, desperate defenses against
        crazed hordes in boarded up cabins, outrageous assaults on a heavily
        fortified castle, skulking sections through shadowy laboratories,
        explosive minecart chases, and countless run-ins with some truly twisted
        freaks infected with the mutating Las Plagas parasite, all of which look
        consistently incredible reimagined on Capcom’s RE Engine (which also
        powered the last two remakes). The original RE4’s famously flabby final
        third has been tightened up considerably, and it all builds towards an
        improved and genuinely imposing final boss fight that took all of my
        skill and ammo reserves to topple.
        <br /><br />
        Of equal importance to its renovated environments and enemies is the
        anxiety-inducing audio design. It can’t be overstated how effective the
        sounds of Resident Evil 4 are when it comes to cultivating a genuine
        sense of dread. Whether it’s the manic chanting of its parasite-riddled
        peasant farmers when you enter a new area, the snarl of wolves as they
        whip through the leaves around you in the castle’s hedge maze, or the
        throaty rumble of a chainsaw motor idling in the distance, just
        listening to it all routinely had me inching towards the edge of my seat
        in anticipation for each enemy encounter, so when the the carnage kicked
        off and the tension spiked I had hardly any couch left to cling to.

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        At every step of the journey there are enhancements, both big and small.
        The original’s gimmicky, quicktime-event-heavy knife battle against
        Major Krauser has been transformed into a gripping blend of parries and
        counter-attacks, while the frustration of escorting Ashley through
        certain sections has been reduced significantly by ditching her health
        bar so you don’t need to waste valuable green herbs on healing her, and
        her intelligence has been improved so she’s less prone to foolishly
        stumble into the hands of a bloodthirsty mob. Elsewhere, there have been
        considerable structural changes that make the environment feel more
        cohesive. For instance, in the original game the lake area primarily
        served as the backdrop to a boss fight, but now you can fully explore
        the lake and its surroundings by boat, docking at various inlets to
        scour cabins and caves for additional puzzles, valuable treasures, and
        hidden horrors lying in wait.
        <br /><br />
        In fact, despite having played the original several times over, there
        still seemed to be something that surprised me around each and every
        corner, and the pacing of Leon’s plight never gets bogged down in the
        sort of storytime stroll that’s become so common in a lot of big-budget
        single-player adventures. With all due respect to the likes of The Last
        of Us and God of War Ragnarok – which are both excellent in their own
        ways – Resident Evil 4 has no time for dialogue-heavy deep and
        meaningfuls. Leon’s foppish haircut might scream noughties emo but his
        stoic attitude is all-out ‘80s action hero, and no matter how much I had
        to Tetris-swap the expanding selection of guns and ammo to fit his
        inventory case he always seemed to have plenty of room left up his
        sleeve for a winking one-liner to whip out after a thoroughly insane
        action sequence before sliding a fresh clip into his submachine gun and
        running headlong into the next.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        When you do need to take a breather, the mysterious merchant returns to
        keep Leon topped up with a suite of dangerous devices like a quaint form
        of Q Branch, along with new recipes that allow you to craft the exact
        ammo types you want when out in the world rather than having to rely on
        randomised drops. He also pays the bounties on the optional side quests
        that have been added throughout the campaign, like shooting down hidden
        blue medallions or tracking down a rare golden chicken egg, which proved
        to be fun little diversions away from the story’s murderous main path.
        These bounties are paid in spinel gemstones which can be traded for
        unique items and upgrades outside of his standard inventory of wares, so
        although I was initially sad to see the iconic red dot sight removed
        from Leon’s starting pistol, it only took me a few short quests to be
        able to buy one and satisfyingly fit it myself.
        <br /><br />
        One thing in particular that I appreciate about the remake’s merchant is
        that he’s a lot more generous when it comes to the trade-in value of
        your weapons. In the original it never really made sense to invest too
        heavily in upgrading the base pistol and shotgun early on, only for
        their value to drop dramatically when it came time to trade up for some
        beefier boomsticks. However, in the remake you’re effectively refunded
        close to the full value of each weapon along with the cost of any
        upgrades you’ve added to it, so you can re-spec your favourite guns and
        boost them towards their optimal forms without copping as big a penalty
        to your purse of Spanish pesetas.
        <br /><br />
        The merchant also gives you access to the new bolt thrower weapon during
        your first encounter, and its reusable bolts come in handy in the
        story’s early hours when you’re still finding your feet as far as
        managing ammunition reserves and crafting resources goes. Yet despite
        his generous prices and fabulous wares, I couldn’t help but feel a
        little shortchanged after each transaction; his re-recorded dialogue
        isn’t delivered with quite the same kind of goofy charm as that of the
        grizzled original. However, in the scheme of things it says a lot for
        the overall quality of this remake when the only minor black mark I can
        give it is for its slightly blander black market dealer – and if this is
        your first time playing it won’t bother you in the slightest.
        <br /><br />
        It’s also a shame that The Mercenaries mode isn’t included at launch,
        although it’s reassuring to know that it will be coming as part of a
        free update sometime in the future, and I’m extremely keen to tackle its
        frantic time attack challenges with the benefits of Leon’s more
        malleable move set. In the meantime there’s a New Game+ mode and a
        lengthy list of in-game challenges to complete in order to unlock
        additional weapons, costumes, and concept art, though it seems that
        bonus modes Assignment Ada and Separate Ways that were present in older
        versions of Resident Evil 4 have either been scrapped or potentially
        saved for DLC. Their loss isn’t that big of a deal since they were never
        as huge a draw as The Mercenaries for me personally, but when a campaign
        is consistently this amazing, it’s hard not to feel greedy for a little
        bit more.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're a fan of the original or a newcomer with a hankering for
        some action-heavy horror of the highest quality, Resident Evil 4 is like
        a parasite-riddled Spaniard: a total no-brainer. Its combat is
        friction-free but no less stress-inducing thanks to its ferocious cast
        of creatures, its story rapidly shuttles through a series of action
        scenes that are diverse in structure but uniformly unwavering in
        intensity, and its world is rich in detail and full of fun and often
        snarling surprises. Its improvements over the original are too numerous
        to list, from simple quality of life changes to completely overhauled

        Resident Evil adventure of all time that’s been rebuilt, refined, and
        realised to the full limits of its enormous potential. A wise choice,
        mate.
