      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        From the city street shootouts of Heat to the creepy clown masks found
        in The Dark Knight’s opening moments, there’s something alarmingly
        alluring about the Hollywood bank heist fantasy. Fortunately, the
        excellent Payday series has been letting me live it out for myself for
        more than a decade without needing to establish a rap sheet. The next
        chapter in this long-running burglary simulator, Payday 3, has finally
        been released from custody, and though it continues the series’
        tradition of delivering one of the best digital smash and grab
        experiences out there, the usual horrible Payday bugs, a dinky pool of
        jobs to tackle, and a predictably weak story mean it’s not exactly the
        giant leap forward I was hoping for. Still, if Payday 2’s post-launch
        support is any indication, this is at least a very promising start for
        what could become another decade of happily pistol whipping cashiers and
        fixing drills.
        <br /><br />
        Like its predecessor, Payday 3 is a cooperative multiplayer FPS where
        you and three friends take on increasingly elaborate heists. The
        extremely thin story focuses on the same motley crew of criminals as
        they’re forced out of retirement by a secretive cabal of shadowy and
        generic silhouettes. All your favorite entrepreneurial personalities are
        back, including Hoxton, the chain smoking mastermind, and Chains, the
        always hilarious military man. Unfortunately, and perhaps
        unsurprisingly, the story itself is just a sequence of slides with
        voiceover justifying the string of jobs you’ll undertake with precious
        little to tie them together. There’s even a mission where you work with
        Ice-T… for some reason? (And yes, I do mean that Ice-T from all 500,000
        episodes of Law & Order.) Payday does love a good cameo, and though it
        definitely makes for an entertaining little encounter, it didn’t exactly
        do much to draw me into an already barebones tale. But even if the story
        never really takes off, it does do a good job at setting the stage while
        hinting at what that future might bring.
        <br /><br />
        Within seconds of beginning my first robbery at the obligatory “local
        bank branch” intro level, the movement and gunplay already felt
        enormously upgraded. You move faster overall and can do more modern
        maneuvers like sliding, which I found useful in combat as well as for
        stealth. Weapons feel more punchy and satisfying, even if they are
        burdened with hopelessly small magazines and long reload times before
        you’ve spent some of your ill-gotten cash on upgrades. You can even use
        civilian hostages as a meat shield now, forcing enemies to engage you in
        melee to avoid hurting an innocent soul, which is a nice touch. After
        years of incremental updates to Payday 2, Payday 3 immediately feels
        like a proper sequel in the gameplay department, even if the formula of
        breaking into vaults and throwing bags of cash into an unmarked van
        remains identical.
        <br /><br />
        The weapon selection isn’t nearly as strong as Payday 2’s roster, with
        just 30 to pick from instead of more than one hundred, but the options
        available at present cover all the bases. You’ve got everything from
        deadly and accurate rifles to silenced pistols, and there’s a good mix
        of stealth focused gadgets and tools too, like throwing daggers that are
        perfect for sneaky tryhards, and devious jammers that can gunk up enemy
        comms. Weapons can also be customized with mods and attachments that
        significantly alter how they are used, like putting a scope on a weapon
        to increase its range, or adding a silencer to a giant rifle to make it
        an option during stealth runs.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The new heists are great, but there are disappointingly few of them.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Payday 3 also raises the bar with the quality of its misadventures, as
        the vast majority of the eight available jobs are super well-designed.
        Many feel like instant classics, like the art museum heist, Under The
        Surphaze, with its delicate puzzles and labyrinthine halls hiding
        priceless art to be pilfered, or the fantastic Gold & Shark bank heist
        that throws you into the most elaborate old fashioned vault break-in
        yet. Developer Starbreeze has definitely upped its game in terms of
        variety and quality with these base stages, and I found myself
        immediately repeating a completed job more often than not, just to
        practice my strategies and explore other possible outcomes. That said,
        there are still some weaker levels, like Road Rage, which is a
        combat-focused mission that has you guiding an armored van on a bridge
        with very little room for deploying different strategies and no stealth
        option whatsoever. Thankfully, that was the only one of the eight that
        was especially weak, and the highs of the good ones far outshine the
        lows of the less interesting choices.
        <br /><br />
        hile almost all of the new heists are great, it is a bit disappointing
        that there are so few of them after such a long wait. Presumably that
        library will expand dramatically over time, just like the previous entry
        did, but after just five hours I’d already completed all the available
        jobs and had begun the endless grind of repeating those same gigs over
        and over again. The saving grace there is that repeating these missions
        is a lot less monotonous thanks to the variety granted by added stealth
        options that make most jobs feel like two separate levels in one thanks
        to how differently they play from run and gun playthroughs.
        <br /><br />
        In many ways the changes to Payday’s stealth mechanics are even more
        significant than any improvements to movement or combat. Only the most
        committed and elite players stood a chance of pulling off a totally
        clean heist in Payday 2, and proper leveling was basically a requirement
        in order to unlock things like a silent drill to get through vaults
        before making an attempt was even remotely viable. In contrast, Payday 3
        provides new mechanics to support stealth right away, like the ability
        to pickpocket security guards to relieve them of their keycards, or use
        environmental objects to lure them away. That means pulling off a
        clandestine operation here is almost immediately achievable, even with a
        randomly matchmade group of players only loosely communicating with one
        another via text chat.
        <br /><br />
        That’s also largely owing to the clever and fantastic way its missions
        are designed, in which stealth runs are now given a completely different
        route to success. For example, the Secure Capital Bank level normally
        requires players to go the humdrum path of using thermite to burn
        through the top of the bank vault then dive in from the floor above
        before making off with the loot, but this series of objectives smartly
        only triggers as your primary path once players have been caught. Before
        that, your crew can take the much more complex and rewarding route of
        breaking into various parts of the bank to sabotage electrical systems
        and deactivate security measures to gain access to the vault without
        anyone being the wiser, which is essentially an entirely different
        mission if you can pull it off. In Payday 2, that same kind of bank
        heist required players to follow more or less the exact same path of
        drilling through the vault no matter your preferred tactic, and to do it
        stealthily you just had to not get caught.
        <br /><br />
        But all those new options don’t mean pulling off a stealth run is going
        to be easy, and that’s thanks to enhanced enemy AI across the board.
        Guards now respond to your actions, breaking free of their usual patrol
        routes to investigate suspicious activity and doing a whole lot more
        than drawing their gun and shooting you when you’re spotted. For
        example, if you’re found in a private but not entirely suspicious area,
        like the back office at a bank vs. the vault, instead of immediately
        trying to kill you, they’ll simply escort you to a public area and give
        you a good tongue lashing, which can be used by cunning players to
        remove guards from their posts temporarily. That smarter AI extends to
        combat as well, where the police do a great job of swarming you from all
        sides instead of standing around as target practice. They can also
        respond to your actions and try to obstruct your heist, like how they’ll
        pull the fire alarm when you’ve lit up that thermite, using the
        sprinkler system to delay your fire’s progress. Likewise, hostages are
        now much more responsive to your commands and easier to boss around and
        control as you use them as collateral in combat or negotiation.
      </p>
      <h2>The added nuance of phases opens up interesting new strategies.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Which leads me to one of the most exciting changes to the heist formula:
        each job now has specific phases, meaning that instead of either being
        in unmasked stealth mode or chucking grenades around like a maniac,
        there are now defined moments in between those two extremes that allow
        for different parts of the crime fantasy to be more thoroughly explored.
        For example, the “Searching” phase triggers when you’ve caught the
        authorities’ suspicion in a minor way and they begin actively looking
        for you, but all hell hasn’t broken loose just yet, and the
        “Negotiation” phase begins if you ever get caught outright and gives you
        a window of time to lock the place down to prepare for a fight or play
        nice by releasing hostages to delay the authorities storming the place.
        This added nuance opens up some interesting new strategies, like
        hoarding as many hostages as possible to draw out the negotiation phase
        as long as you can. It certainly helps that zip ties required to keep
        hostages in line are no longer a limited resource, too, so you’re able
        to stack those poor bystanders as high as your heart desires.
        <br /><br />
        It’s also still a ton of fun to make your way down its role-based skill
        paths while out committing misdeeds, unlocking more abilities within
        those roles to bolster your preferred playstyle. That could be the The
        Hacker path, which turns your lawbreaker into a tech wizard who can hack
        into security cameras and confound security systems, or the Manipulator
        path, which grants you a silver tongue so you can intimidate civilians
        and law enforcement officials alike into submitting to your indomitable
        will. You can have any four of the 17 available roles equipped at a time
        and can spend your skill points within those however you like, which
        allows you to create the perfect villainous cocktail without wasting any
        cherished points on stuff you won’t use. It’s also nice that you level
        up and upgrade each of these roles by simply equipping them while out on
        crime sprees, which really rewards you for picking your knavery niche
        and sticking to it.
        <br /><br />
        Even though I’ve come around on this new, more streamlined upgrade
        system, I do still miss the depth of Payday 2’s progression. This new
        system checks the most important box by letting me curate my very own
        delinquent based on the role I want to play within the crew, but it’s
        also not quite as chunky or complex – and it’s particularly
        disappointing that Perk Decks have been done away with entirely. Perk
        Decks allowed you to round out your character with minor boons related
        to their background, which was a nice additional system on top of the
        skill trees that gave me another reason to grind. Here’s hoping
        something like that makes a return down the road.
        <br /><br />
        Hopefully that’s not the only update coming, either. As always seems to
        be the case with Payday, severe and horribly painful technical issues
        have returned like the cold sting of the law. Not only are the usual
        connectivity issues back, but there’s occasional framerate hitching,
        people walking backwards for no reason, and more. Even the menu barely
        works at times, and I’d often find it completely unresponsive as I
        spammed buttons before it finally noticed my all inputs at once and did
        insane things like open the same mission 15 times, triggering its intro
        dialogue to play all at once, overlapping in a incredibly disturbing
        way. I’m really hoping they iron this stuff out, but given that past
        entries have remained busted for months and years before finally
        becoming stable, there’s definitely cause for concern that we’re in for
        another rocky ride.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Everything in Payday 3 is a fair bit thinner than Payday 2 for now.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        At least when you’re booted back to lobbies due to connectivity issues,
        you can spend plenty of time customizing your character’s loadout. With
        lots of masks, paints, and trinkets to unlock, you’ll have plenty to
        chase and can waste quite a bit of time and in-game money customizing
        the color and patterns on your weapons or the suits your character wears
        when out committing grand larceny. Like everything else in Payday 3,
        it’s a fair bit thinner than Payday 2 for now, but there’s little doubt
        that will change with time as things are added, and in the meantime
        there’s still quite a bit to unlock. I will say though, I already miss
        the little card minigame that we got at the end of every mission in
        Payday 2, where you had a shot at unlocking the odd cosmetic or weapon
        mod. All those same things are now earned by leveling up and spending
        your stolen cash, but that dopamine hit when the match concluded is
        certainly lost here.
        <br /><br />
        Oh, and as always, the music in Payday 3 absolutely crushes it. Any
        disappointment I may feel when my stealth run fails is immediately
        forgiven once the beat drops and a money-crazed murder spree begins,
        making me feel like a complete badass instead of a heartless psychopath.
        This certainly isn’t new for the series, but it’s great to see they
        haven’t dropped that very important ball.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Payday 3 is a solid step forward for my favorite heist simulator
        franchise, even though that step is a lot smaller than I’d hoped due to
        a lack of content and the unsurprising but still majorly annoying bugs
        and performance issues. The awesome combat, greatly improved AI, and
        especially the stealth options are so massive they alone justify this as
        a full sequel, and the new and improved heists with clear phases to
        navigate them are absolutely fantastic. I just wish there was more loot
        in the proverbial vault at the outset, and that Starbreeze would have
        used its years of experience in order to ensure this was a more robust
        and far more stable launch. I’m confident Payday 3 could become the
        sequel we all deserve with a year or two of updates – for now, it’s a
        nice start.
