      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        By their very competitive, dog-eat-dog nature, battle royale games don’t
        tend to be about making friends with the people you meet. But with its
        big 2.0 revamp, Call of Duty: Warzone has made some admirable efforts
        toward inspiring us to work together, communicate, and socialize even as
        we fight to be the last ones standing. Some of its other new ideas don’t
        pay off quite as well, such as the relatively bland new map and its
        ill-advised backpack system. But even if you put all of that aside, the
        introduction of an excellent new PvPvE mode is more than reason enough
        to round up a squad and drop back into Warzone for a few matches. After
        all, the real victory screen might just be the friends we made along the
        way.
        <br /><br />
        The first thought-provoking new social idea is that you can actually
        recruit enemy players to your team in squad-based lobbies if you end up
        losing a teammate at any point. This is a clever way to give weakened
        teams or solo stragglers a fighting chance, and to keep more people
        invested in a match for longer. It’s also just fun to make friends in a
        battle royale, though it’s an idea that might work better on paper than
        in practice. Most people still tend to open fire on sight, so I’ve yet
        to successfully convince anyone to join my team, but the fact that I can
        at least try is a fun addition on its own.
        <br /><br />
        The Unhinged Trios mode even lets you invite up to six people to be on
        your team mid-match, living up to its name in the chaos that creates.
        Well, that it could create – a lot of people don’t really seem to want
        to play with six people on a team and would often just not work
        together. I guess we all took it to heart when our parents told us you
        can’t trust anyone on the internet, and you mostly see people playing
        Unhinged Trios as normal trios. I still liked it just fine in that
        context too, but the actual gameplay mechanic of it being a squad
        building simulator was a little disappointing when no one really wanted
        to participate in that aspect.
        <br /><br />
        Our new battleground, Al Mazrah, is an interesting map to explore thanks
        to its many cities full of buildings to loot from and 18 points of
        interest, from a literal fortress to airports and even a mining city.
        That said, the vast stretches of terrain between those exciting locales
        aren’t quite as varied, and I felt like I was really just looking at a
        lot of sandy and beige backgrounds as I ran through the map. I
        understand Al Mazrah is a take on a realistic region with cities and
        industrial areas sprinkled throughout, but the fact that buildings and
        houses in those cities all look so similar and the same color palette is
        applied through the entire map makes it less pretty to look at than a
        lot of other current battle royale arenas. Apex Legends and Fortnite, by
        contrast, have extremely varied terrain (and even weather), particularly
        with Apex’s World’s Edge that contains snow, lava, and urban landscapes
        splayed out in one single map.
        <br /><br />
        However, Al Mazrah is the biggest map Warzone has seen to date, allowing
        it to comfortably accommodate 150 players, and it has some new cool
        water passageways throughout that let you travel via boat alongside land
        and air vehicles. I like that it opens up travel options to water
        because it means you’re not always forced to take a car or attempt to
        grab a helicopter from an extremely exposed location. It also gives us
        more options for escape routes, especially since the waterways take
        different turns through the map from roads.
      </p>
      <h2>
        I’ve enjoyed the twist of having to constantly watch the map and pivot
        my movement in less predictable ways.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The areas between each cluster of buildings are pretty open and really
        demonstrate how big the map is when you’re on foot and trying to run
        from one location to another. This could’ve been a problem, but with the
        way Warzone 2.0 has reworked the ever-tightening circle it’s not too big
        of a deal. The original Warzone had a traditional single safe circle; in
        2.0, there’s a chance for that one circle to split into three that are
        spread across the map, forcing you to scramble to the closest one to
        survive. The three circles will then collapse back into one for the
        final minutes of a match, forcing the survivors among all three isolated
        groups to finally face off in one area. This is a fresh and unique
        approach to the battle royale format, and I’ve enjoyed the twist of
        having to constantly watch the map and pivot my movement in less
        predictable ways. Even better is when my team and I find good buildings
        to hunker down in and try and pick off stragglers who weren’t paying
        attention to the splits.
        <br /><br />
        Warzone 2.0 also brought in a novel new take on the Gulag mode (where
        you go when you’re knocked out of the main match) in which you may be
        paired up with a random enemy in a temporary truce, so you have to make
        nice with a stranger to get a second chance at life. It’s clever, but it
        did get a little frustrating since communicating with your random
        teammate isn’t exactly consistent, sometimes leaving me feeling like I
        was really fighting a 1v2. Also, if you get sent to the Gulag and find
        there’s only one other player there, you often times can’t get into a
        full Gulag match – once the timer runs out you simply get kicked back
        onto the battlefield. So while this new system is interesting, I still
        prefer the old 1v1 Gulag because you could rely on yourself and match
        times were short.
        <br /><br />
        However, one fun change in the Gulag is that you don’t necessarily have
        to beat all the enemy players to get back into the match. Instead,
        everyone can band together to take down an AI-controlled Juggernaut
        Jailer that jumps into the arena after a certain amount of time has
        passed; if you’re successful, everybody who is still alive can redeploy.
        Alternatively, you can continue to try for a full enemy team wipe as
        chaos ensues – and predictably, most of the time people have opted for
        the bloodthirsty option of killing each other in the hopes of a selfish
        revival. I also had a match where the Jailer actually ended up taking
        out the last enemy player for me and I got redeployed with my teammate,
        so the new variation of the Gulag certainly has some really fun moments
        when it works properly. Hopefully over time we’ll see people team up
        against the common foe more often.
        <br /><br />
        One of the best new additions in Warzone 2.0 is proximity chat, which
        allows anybody who gets close enough to listen in on your voice coms.
        That’s a fun and sneaky experience that you don’t get very often in
        battle royales. I could, for example, hear a team in the building next
        door discussing how they could hear me and my teammate looting, giving
        away their location when they might otherwise have gotten the drop on
        me. Warzone has always had death comms where you’d hear the enemy
        player’s mic just after you’d killed them, which is a fun way to revel
        in their defeat, but proximity chat really changes that in an
        interesting way.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Proximity chat has made the whole experience of Warzone so much better.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Proximity chat is one of those mechanics I didn’t think an FPS or battle
        royale needed but it’s made the whole experience of Warzone so much
        better. Because Warzone is crossplay, you can sometimes hear people
        unknowingly playing with their mics open on their controllers once you
        get near them. I’ve had some fun conversations with enemies too, just
        talking to them casually and butting into conversations, or throwing
        playful banter around as we try to hunt each other down. It’s also
        allowed for some really funny moments where people will get creative
        with it and, say, pose as taxi drivers for otherwise hostile players in
        a temporary truce and exchange money for rides around the map.
        <br /><br />
        Proximity chat has really made Warzone feel like a lively battleground
        with the constant reminder that the players you’re fighting against for
        survival are other humans. Of course, this doesn’t always mean those
        interactions will be great – I’ve gotten some less-than-tasteful remarks
        and overheard certain conversations I’d rather not have. But most of the
        time it’s a fun option to turn on if you’re interested in being social
        or hearing when enemies are nearby to get a slight advantage.
        <br /><br />
        I’m less enthusiastic about Warzone 2.0’s new lootable backpacks, which
        allow you to carry more items without sacrificing ammo and armor plate
        space. It’s certainly a bold choice for Call of Duty because Apex
        Legends’ similar tiered backpack system has been a topic of contentious
        debate among that community – rather than having to find them as loot,
        should we just have bigger backpacks on drop or be able to craft one
        consistently?
      </p>
      <h2>Having limited slots in a backpack is a bit annoying.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        After playing with it in Warzone 2.0, I have to side more with the
        latter camp. I’ve found myself frustrated when I’m running out of ammo
        or armor plates because I couldn’t carry enough with the standard
        backpack and wasn’t able to find an ammunition replenishment crate or
        armor supply crate to carry as backups. Previously, ammo and inventory
        management wasn’t really an issue since you could just collect the max
        amount for each type and auto-fill your tactical and lethal equipment as
        well. Having limited slots in a backpack is a bit annoying, especially
        now that in order to loot specific items you have to click on what
        you’re looting, say a box or an enemy’s dropped backpack, and
        individually click on what you want to take or swap. This slows down the
        looting process and can mean an aggravating death if you’re looking
        through an enemy’s backpack and suddenly need to swap guns or ammo. It’s
        just made gameplay more sluggish, and it feels like a step back from the
        original Warzone where you could simply run over things, loot quickly,
        and proceed with your game.
        <br /><br />
        Additionally, the armor vests have been changed so that you only get
        slot-two armor plates on drop, forcing you to loot a higher value
        three-plate vest just to be protected at max capacity.
        <br /><br />
        One nice thing about this change is that when you hit an enemy you get
        an indication as to what armor they’re wearing: blue hitmarkers reveal
        an enemy has the two-plate vest and purple indicates a three-plate. This
        gives you more information as you’re making the split-second decision on
        how you want to approach the enemy – if they have better gear than you,
        a hasty retreat might be a better idea.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A revised ping system has finally caught Warzone up to other battle
        royales.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Elsewhere, a revised ping system has finally caught Warzone up to other
        battle royales, which was long overdue. It gives you a whole wheel’s
        worth of options for how you’d like to point out enemies, allowing you
        to play without having to be on voice chat. Even when I am, though, I
        like to use it to point out specifically where I saw an enemy by
        Double-tapping the ping button. Highlighting an enemy with a live ping,
        where the ping moves with a tagged enemy for a short amount of time, is
        especially useful and nice to have. Also, if you wanted to avoid being
        overheard on proximity chat, this could double as a stealth tactic. It’s
        only improved the gameplay of Warzone 2.0.
        <br /><br />
        Despite everything that’s been improved, the overall user interface of
        Warzone 2.0 has left a lot to be desired, especially since things seem
        to have been made complicated for no reason. The gunsmith’s unlocks work
        by progressing through a new gun family tree called Platforms. You have
        to hit specific weapon levels within a Platform to unlock new Receivers,
        weapons in its line. For example, if you unlock the M4, you can open the
        progression tab and see you’ve got two tracks to unlock the 556 Icarus
        or the FTAC Recon. It’s very visually confusing, though thankfully not a
        huge deal overall as you still unlock guns really quickly just by
        playing Warzone or the new DMZ mode. In fact, DMZ is the best option for
        unlocking and leveling guns since you can pick up any weapon and level
        them just by having them in your loadout.
      </p>
      <h2>DMZ is the best option for unlocking and leveling guns.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        DMZ pushes Warzone beyond the traditional battle royal crowd as Call of
        Duty’s take on an extraction mode. No doubt inspired by the success of
        games like Escape from Tarkov, DMZ has strongholds stocked with big
        groups of NPCs located throughout the map that you can infiltrate, which
        keeps rounds from ever feeling like they are lacking gunfights – and of
        course there’s a server of up to 66 players or 22 three-man human teams
        vying for the same targets. It’s a really fun and refreshing change of
        pace between rounds of battle royale.
        <br /><br />
        Since it also takes place on Al Mazrah, I’ve found that DMZ is a great
        way to explore and get familiar with its locations. It also has its own
        set of faction missions you can complete for XP bundles and additional
        rewards like weapon blueprints, calling cards, operator skins, and
        others. You can select up to three missions at a time from the factions:
        Legion (the easiest difficulty to complete), White Lotus (medium
        difficulty), and Black Mous (hard difficulty). I thoroughly enjoyed
        strategizing with my teammates about which missions we could work to
        complete together since the entire team can help – if the mission calls
        for you to destroy six vehicles, anyone on your team could destroy a
        vehicle and it would count towards your completion. Mission systems like
        this are really nice for adding replayability and direction to a PvPvE
        mode since that format can sometimes get stale without any clearly
        stated goals.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve kept coming back to DMZ over Warzone due to it being so easy to
        just queue into and play, without all the commitment of a full 25 to
        30-minute battle royale match. You control the match length since you
        can opt to extract at any point, or try to hold out for the final
        extraction time at the end. Even if I don’t get an extraction and lose
        the items I had collected, I don’t feel discouraged because the
        experience of DMZ with your squad is just so fun on its own. Being able
        to run around, explore, and rampage through AI enemies on Al Mazrah is a
        fresh break from the battle royale survival tactics. You can breathe,
        have fun, and focus on completing missions for rewards you share across
        your Warzone account rather than always trying to be the last person
        standing. That shared progression in particular really encouraged me to
        put more time into DMZ without feeling like I was neglecting my Warzone
        unlocks.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Building on the already rock-solid foundation of the original Warzone,
        Warzone 2.0 is a positive update to Call of Duty’s battle royale mode,
        even with few drawbacks of its own. Its new map isn’t the most exciting
        outside of being the biggest ever brought to Warzone, but great
        additions like proximity chat and an updated ping system change things
        up and bring new life to the struggle for survival. And while adding
        backpacks as lootable gear may have slowed down looting in general, the
        new take on the Gulag creates some memorable moments if you can convince
        your fellow prisoners to team up against a common enemy for the greater
        good. And, as an added bonus, the new DMZ extraction mode revitalizes
