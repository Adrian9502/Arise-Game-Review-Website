      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        Honkai: Star Rail starts with a bang, serenading you with a symphony and
        blowing up a space station. You quickly ground yourself in a world with
        code-locked chrome doors, mech-like invaders with bladed arms, and rooms
        with monitors spread across the walls. Its hook of a prologue gives just
        enough that you can see why the story and gameplay are worth sticking
        around for without grinding. Charming characters, engaging combat, and
        carefully crafted worlds blend together into a game with enough content
        to keep you entertained for well over 50 hours, using polished versions
        of the progression systems from Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact to
        create HoYoverse’s best RPG yet.
        <br /><br />
        HoYo has a reputation for crafting gacha games with a strong emphasis on
        story, and Honkai: Star Rail lives up to it. You play as the
        Trailblazer, an amnesiac protagonist who travels planet to planet on a
        train-like spaceship-like train called the Astral Express. It becomes a
        story surrounding the train’s crew, their backstories, and the different
        planets they visit. The story has its own twists and turns with some
        questionable pacing, but eventually it leads to an entertaining outcome
        that kept me wanting more.
        <br /><br />
        Major story arcs dip into the city of Belobog’s political conflict and
        its poverty-stricken Underworld. It also balances darker themes like
        loss with lighthearted jokes, some of which reference pop culture or RPG
        cliches. Weaving these threads together puts the spotlight on other
        characters and makes the overall story more cohesive as a whole. These
        arcs kept me up at night, grinding through levels just so I could get to
        the next quest.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, the story is far from finished. HoYo still plans to add more
        in future updates like it has and still does with Genshin Impact, but
        Honkai: Star Rail already succeeds at slowly revealing small details
        about each character and creating situations that bring out the
        different facets of their personalities. It welcomes you with an
        intriguing mystery at the very beginning, and that sense of intrigue
        continues far into the campaign.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        You can’t play certain story quests or unlock certain abilities until
        you reach a high enough level, so you need to grind through battles and
        missions for experience. However, I appreciated that level-locked
        content as an excuse to explore the world outside of the major story
        quests and build characters before fighting higher-level enemies.
        <br /><br />
        Honkai: Star Rail has three major worlds so far, each of which has a
        wealth of details hidden in every nook and cranny. You trigger many
        interactions and learn new information from just investigating random
        objects and talking to your travel buddies and NPCs. Just interacting
        with every trash can in the city of Belobog can raise a reaction from
        your confused companions. Even Pom-Pom, the Astral Express conductor,
        seems like he has something new to tell you whenever you visit the
        Express. On top of that, each Light Cone (weapon-like cards that you
        attach to your characters to raise their stats and grant them special
        abilities) has a snippet of lore attached to it, sometimes related to
        memories of playable characters. There are also tons of in-game books
        and documents that I might never read, but are there in case anyone
        wants to take an even deeper dive into the lore.
        <br /><br />
        That’d all be for naught without the rewarding progression, though.
        Honkai: Star Rail leads you step by step through the layers of
        increasingly complicated systems as you level up, which helps prevent
        beginners from being overwhelmed with too much information at once.
        There are separate leveling systems for your account, characters,
        abilities, world (difficulty level), and two types of equipment – not to
        mention the various drops you use to level everything up. All these
        leveling items come from different places, so it can be a lot to
        remember at the beginning when you’re just learning how to play.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It can be a lot to remember when you’re just learning how to play.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        At first, only golden Calyxes (challenges you complete for resources)
        offer materials for leveling up characters and equipment. However, the
        list of materials you need to improve characters expands as their levels
        climb. At level 20, your character only needs ascension books (the
        standard XP-raising materials) to ascend to the next level; at level 40,
        they need specific materials related to their elemental type or role.
        These materials come from crimson Calyxes and Stagnant Shadows, two
        other types of challenges, unlock after you hit a high enough level.
        <br /><br />
        You then need to decide how to spend your Trailblaze Power, the main
        consumable resource you need to claim rewards from these challenges. Do
        you want to level up your characters’ abilities first? Or do you want to
        level up their Light Cone? At some point, it’s impossible to do all of
        them in one day without replenishing your Trailblaze Power with
        consumable items. Those come at a pace that feels fast enough when
        playing for free, but this is where HoYo encourages impatient people
        with cash on hand to pay to speed up their progress.
        <br /><br />
        Honkai: Star Rail features a turn-based combat system that gives you
        plenty to consider in terms of strategy, making it all the more
        satisfying when you pull off a victory. Thanks to the fact that each
        character is a combination of two types – a class (called a path) like
        damage dealer or support, and an elemental affinity similar to Pokémon –
        there’s enough variety that I never got tired of experimenting with team
        composition. Some teams may have an ace defender instead of a healer, or
        someone that debuffs enemies instead of buffing their own team members.
        For instance, if I buff my strongest character with a support ability,
        they can one-hit KO enemies and gain another turn; I also gave my
        favorite shielder equipment that raises their defense stat and gives
        them a higher chance of burning enemies. You also have a chance to
        switch teammates around depending on the weaknesses of the upcoming
        enemies, so planning ahead can be just as important as what you do when
        the fight begins.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, Honkai: Star Rail keeps the infuriating artifact system
        from Genshin Impact in the form of its Relics, which are gear that you
        equip on characters to boost their stats. There are too many layers that
        rely on chance, though, because which stat increases when you level up
        is randomized. Even if you have a Relic with at least three desirable
        substats, it’s still possible that the system will funnel every boost
        into the worst one. For example, one Relic could have critical damage,
        critical rate, attack, and a flat defense (not defense percentage, which
        is different) as its four substats. It seems like an ideal Relic for a
        damage-dealing character because of the critical and attack stats, but
        could become completely useless if your luck decides to level up flat
        defense every time.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Unfortunately, Honkai: Star Rail keeps the infuriating artifact system
        from Genshin Impact.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        To its credit, HoYoverse has implemented a custom Relic system that
        allows you to craft your own Relics with enough of the related
        consumable item. That said, you still have to waste time stressing over
        Relics until you’ve played for hours and found enough junk to exchange
        for an ideal piece of gear. Of course, you should still be able to
        triumph in battle without the best Relics, even if it’ll be more
        difficult. Honkai: Star Rail rewards those who put in the effort but
        goes easy on those who don’t want to.
        <br /><br />
        That said, this isn’t the kind of game for someone who just wants to run
        on cruise control. You have to be willing to put in the effort to learn
        the different systems, enough to build a strategy and manage your
        resources as efficiently as you can while enjoying the story and
        characters. Beginners might get away with throwing on whatever gear they
        find without leveling them up or considering the stats, but it becomes
        more difficult after a certain point without proper investment. If
        you’re not paying attention battles can drag on for many reasons,
        including poor team synergy, underleveled characters and equipment, or
        type disadvantages.
        <br /><br />
        I have many memories of grueling boss battles, including one where I
        needed to constantly shield and heal to survive because I was
        underleveled but impatient. Eventually, my team failed: my main
        damage-dealer barely dented the armor bar, even though they had a type
        advantage, and my healer wasn’t enough to keep the team afloat against
        the boss’ multi-target charge attack.
        <br /><br />
        Even when you lose in Honkai: Star Rail, it feels like it genuinely
        encourages you to do better without punishing you. It gave me helpful
        tips that pushed me to reconsider the abilities I was using, like if I
        had enough attack on my main character and where I could get more
        resources to level up my gear. And of course, I had to stop to level up
        my Light Cones so I wasn’t quite so outmatched before I went up against
        that boss again. The fact that Honkai: Star Rail even suggests courses
        of action and how to look at your stats is a smart addition that will
        help less experienced players learn the ropes.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The best missions involve characters I felt attached to, and even the
        ones without flashy cutscenes made my heart race.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That’s just some of the tons of text you’ll have to read in Honkai: Star
        Rail. Some scenarios are voice-acted, which added to the drama and my
        investment. Long explanations from NPCs can feel entertaining thanks to
        lively voice performances, but in many cases you should prepare for lots
        of text. The wordy dialogues make sense in the main missions because the
        little details add up to give you a bigger picture of what’s happening
        in the plot. The best missions involve characters I felt attached to,
        and even the ones without flashy cutscenes made my heart race.
        <br /><br />
        Many missions outside of the main story also flesh out the worlds that
        you visit with entertaining and sometimes heartbreaking scenarios. You
        do get to make some decisions that have enough weight to potentially
        ruin some NPCs’ lives, but they don’t drastically change the outcome of
        the plot. That’s understandable considering this is an ongoing story and
        the developers can only create so many branching paths. Should you send
        a known scammer to jail, even if he makes people happy with his lies?
        Should you pull the plug on a well-meaning robot to stop a possible
        rampage, even if it would essentially remove their emotional
        intelligence and individuality? You can bully your clumsy crewmate or
        wag your finger at a mean old man. It’s your choice, and it kept me
        invested in the characters’ reactions to me and the outcome of my
        decisions.
        <br /><br />
        However, some side quests have a lot of information without as much
        investment. It starts to feel like a chore rather than an accomplishment
        to wrap up lingering side quests. Perhaps if there were more hidden
        character lore in them like in the character-focused Companion Missions,
        they would be more enticing than just gaining points at the end.
        <br /><br />
        It’s so much more than that, anyway. I can go on about all the little
        quality-of-life details that Honkai: Star Rail includes that veterans of
        other HoYo games will appreciate, like how its descriptions highlight
        in-game jargon like “Break Effect” that might need explaining, and offer
        a definition when you click on it. It also has a Recommended Gear button
        that you can use to automatically choose Relics for each character if
        you don’t want to spend time crunching numbers. And each enemy has icons
        indicating their weaknesses before you even approach them, in case you
        forget. They even have at least two weaknesses so that you don’t feel
        like you’re disadvantaged because of just one missing element, which
        makes it much more forgiving if you haven’t covered every single element
        in your party.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Honkai: Star Rail is the best free-to-play game of the year so far. Its
        stellar storytelling and satisfying progression systems offer dozens of
        hours of content that a HoYo newcomer can enjoy, even without paying for
        gacha items or having played Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact. Combat
        boasts layers of strategy for those willing to dig into details without
        barring more casual players from enjoying it. Its worldbuilding also
        expands outside of the main story into the side missions and
        interactable objects, making an already captivating world even more
        lively. It surpasses even Genshin in my mind, and I can see myself
        playing even months from now.
