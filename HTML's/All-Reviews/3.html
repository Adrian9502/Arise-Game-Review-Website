      <span class="author">
        BY TRAVIS NORTHUP | POSTED: SEP 13, 2023 11:00 PM
      </span>
      <p>
        You know we’ve entered a new era in the increasingly crowded soulslike
        arms race when we’re now turning classic children’s stories into dark,
        twisted Bloodborne pseudo-sequels, but hey: here we are. Yes, Lies of P
        is yet another game inspired by the dark and unforgiving FromSoftware
        masterpieces that have captured the hearts of so many (myself included),
        but it’s also an undeniably impressive standout amid a sea of games
        chasing the soulslike trend. It suffers from some uneven difficulty and
        overly linear level design, but its impressive story, extremely
        well-tuned combat, and memorable areas and boss fights mean that this
        isn’t one you should miss out on. It’s fair to say that sometimes Lies
        of P emulates its inspiration so closely it feels like someone else is
        pulling its strings a little too forcefully, but that puppet show is
        still a whole lot of fun to watch.
        <br /><br />
        It’s both praise and criticism to say that Lies of P follows the
        blueprint pioneered by FromSoftware down to the finest detail, with
        precious few deviations. The UI and menus are strikingly similar to
        every soulslike you’ve ever played, the aesthetic is almost identical to
        Bloodborne, and combat is a methodical dance of attacks and parries
        designed with difficulty in mind. It sticks so close to the script that
        it got to the point where I’d meet a seemingly friendly character and
        think “Ah, this is the one who’s going to betray me later,” with full
        confidence that I was spot on in that assessment. There’s even a major
        boss with the same name and rough appearance as a Dark Souls boss, which
        is honestly just kinda hilarious.
        <br /><br />
        In fact, this isn’t even the first Eurocentric soulslike featuring
        murderous marionettes! Almost exactly one year ago I reviewed
        Steelrising, which has a bizarre number of things in common with Lies of
        P, from its mechanical enemies gone mad to its trendy and historical
        urban setting. Thankfully, Lies of P is a much better game and manages
        to stand out in other ways, but it doesn’t exactly earn a whole lot of
        points for originality.
        <br /><br />
        One of the ways it does set itself apart though is with its story, which
        is a dark reimagining of Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio – a story about a
        mischievous puppet known for telling falsehoods and longing to become a
        real boy. Lies of P’s version takes a lot of liberty in its much more
        gory and depressing version of the classic tale, but it's got some nice
        nods to its inspiration, including an untrustworthy cat and fox and a
        neat mechanic where you have to choose to tell lies or the truth (which
        have an impact on the outcome of your adventure).
      </p>
      <h2>The story has some interesting twists and memorable characters.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This style of game isn’t known for having the most comprehensible
        stories and Lies of P isn’t wholly an exception to that rule, but it
        does try more than most. There’s a whole bunch of dialogue and cutscenes
        that kept my interest throughout my first 30-hour run instead of just a
        loose collection of vagaries and hints in item descriptions. In fact, of
        all the distressing and enigmatic stories I’ve seen in this genre, this
        is definitely among one of my favorites – not quite as relatable and
        polished as something like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, but certainly more
        approachable than your Bloodbornes or your Dark Souls. It’s got some
        interesting twists and turns, and a few memorable characters too, like
        the self-obsessed socialite Venigni, who constantly made me want to
        speak in an over-the-top Italian accent.
        <br /><br />
        As you’d expect, you’ll split your time hacking your way through levels
        where practically everything in sight wants to kill you and taking on
        much more formidable bosses, and Lies of P largely nails both of those
        genre pillars. The city of Krat is memorable and dystopian, while also
        continuously reminding you that you’re playing out an iconic fairytale
        about puppets. It comes complete with your cricket sidekick Gemini and
        your puppet-making father Gepetto, who always reminds you to be a good
        boy right before he sends you on missions to butcher everyone in your
        path. You’ll visit a puppet graveyard that serves as a kind of poison
        swamp level that every soulslike legally is required to include, and an
        exhibition hall filled with hopeful depictions of a future that clearly
        didn’t work out quite as planned, among others. Each is thoroughly
        enjoyable to stab your way through.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a little disappointing though, that Lies of P is far more linear
        than most similar games, with a very straightforward path from beginning
        to end and no significant optional areas or boss fights aside from the
        odd side quest that sends you back to someplace you’ve already visited
        to solve a small puzzle in exchange for a new outfit or upgrade
        material. Once you’ve played through the story, you’ll more or less have
        seen and done everything there is to see and do – except to do it again
        on New Game+, of course.
        <br /><br />
        Another item on the checklist is some memorable (and usually disgusting)
        boss fights, and Lies of P’s got those in spades. From an evil puppet
        law enforcement official to a hulked-out guy who’s basically just Bane
        from Batman, there’s lots of big things that need to be slapped in the
        face. Doing so is always enjoyable, even though they’re all pretty
        straightforward encounters where you whittle down the enemy’s health
        bar. It would have been nice to have one or two encounters where they
        mix things up with a puzzle or trick you’ve gotta figure out to best
        your opponent – those are always my favorite.
      </p>
      <h2>Aggressive gameplay is encouraged, and that keeps fights moving.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Also, almost all of the bosses have two phases, which I’m normally a fan
        of, but they’re used to the point where it became a little grating by
        the end. Usually the first phase is quite easy, but when the second
        phase is repeatedly killing me and I have to keep replaying that first
        phase until I’m completely bored by it, I kinda just wish I could skip
        it and get to the part that’s actually fun and challenging. Many fights
        felt like they put the first phase there just as a warmup round before
        getting to the actual meat of the encounter, but rest assured: by the
        10th attempt I was thoroughly warmed up and plenty ready to take another
        shot at the real boss.
        <br /><br />
        For better or worse, much of Lies of P’s combat draws clear inspiration
        from Bloodborne specifically, with a couple minor tweaks. You can’t
        restore health lost from direct attacks by striking back at your enemies
        like in Bloodborne, but you are given the ability to partially block
        some of that incoming damage then counter to restore the chip damage you
        absorbed. The result is a similar meta where aggressive gameplay is
        encouraged, and that keeps fights moving along at a quick pace – but it
        also discourages more defensive playstyles, which tend to be my go-to in
        soulslikes. That feisty combat is extremely fun, balanced, and
        well-tuned, but you’re definitely boxed into playing in a specific way
        instead of allowing you the freedom to craft diverse builds, like a
        ranged magic user in Dark Souls, for example.
        <br /><br />
        Another idea borrowed from Bloodborne is that your melee weapon is
        assigned to your right hand while your left is reserved for a utility
        weapon that often include ranged capabilities by turning your robotic
        left arm into a Winter Soldier-esque tool of destruction, and that ends
        up being a pretty darn clever take on that mechanic. You might decide to
        close gaps quickly with the quick and effective Puppet String, which
        lets you tether a grappling hook onto your enemies, or make use of the
        formidable Falcon Eyes to turn your arm into a cannon and blow up
        deranged puppets from afar, or my personal favorite: use the Aegis
        shield to block incoming attacks and dish out damage in kind with a
        fiery explosion that triggers when it’s hit. It’s especially cool that
        each of these tools can be upgraded with additional effects, like the
        Puppet String’s ability that lets you follow up your grappling hook
        maneuver with a devastating airborne attack.
        <br /><br />
        But it’s the new stuff, namely the completely awesome weapon-crafting
        system that lets you disassemble any weapon in your arsenal and mix and
        match the various hilts and blades to create Frankenstein abominations,
        that really lets Lies of P distinguish itself within a very crowded
        genre. Have you ever wanted to attach a giant saw blade to a rapier’s
        handle so you could jab with it like you’re fencing? Well, it’s probably
        not advisable at all, but knock yourself out. How about attaching
        Mjolnir’s hammer to the end of a rusty pipe? Go for it, man! You do you.
        With dozens of possible combinations, you’re given quite a bit of
        freedom to make some silly or surprisingly effective stuff, as certain
        stats and abilities from your chosen hilt and blade combine for a unique
        combat experience. It’s a bit of a shame, though, that the best weapons
        available are legendary tools that can’t be disassembled and reforged
        into new items, and many of these are so much more powerful than
        anything you can build that you’re sorta disincentivized from actually
        engaging with the crafting system the longer you play.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It’s a bit disappointing that there isn't any kind of multiplayer.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        With all that freedom to create silly weapon combinations, it’s a bit
        disappointing that there aren’t any of the multiplayer modes you find in
        many of Lies of P’s peers. Not having co-op is understandable since it
        might break any semblance of balance (plus, who wants to see two
        Pinocchios wailing on a boss anyway?), but PvP in particular seems like
        it would fit perfectly with the fast-paced contest of reflexes at which
        Lies of P excels. Maybe we’ll get something like that as DLC, but for
        now you’ll need to enjoy your neat builds and creative weapon
        combinations on your lonesome.
        <br /><br />
        Another cool tweak on the formula is Lies of P’s skill tree, which lets
        you upgrade your puppet’s mechanical innards to snap up some seriously
        useful upgrades, like adding amulet slots to your loadout, gaining
        additional Pulse Cells (that are used for healing), and increasing the
        number of consumable throwing objects you can carry on your person. I
        spent way too long agonizing over each upgrade decision and considering
        different ways to optimize my build to improve my chances of becoming a
        real boy, and that was a pretty nice change of pace in between all those
        unfortunate murders I had to commit.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, the main thing that defines any good soulslike is how
        soul-crushingly difficult it is, and Lies of P has mixed success in this
        regard. On one hand, nearly all of the world exploration where I was
        fighting your run-of-the-mill evil puppets and gross monsters was
        disappointingly easy, to the point where death was a rare occurrence
        throughout my playthroughs. The same can be said of most boss fights,
        which Souls veterans can expect to beat without breaking too much of a
        sweat since they’re usually big, slow, and stupid creatures who are
        easily confused when you move behind or underneath them and telegraph
        all their attacks like they’re in the WWE.
        <br /><br />
        But then I’d encounter the occasional showdown where the difficulty
        spiked up dramatically without warning and I’d die 20 or 30 agonizing
        deaths on a single boss, leaving me to wonder if I just wasn’t properly
        leveled or something (which was never the case – I just needed to git
        gud). Those specific bosses stand in such stark contrast to the much
        milder exploration sections that it can be quite jarring, and I often
        felt like the levels preceding a tough boss didn’t properly prepare me
        for that gauntlet; more likely, my skills probably worsened during the
        stretch of mostly undemanding travels between the dramatically more
        difficult boss fights.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Easier stretches separate dramatically more difficult boss fights.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That inconsistent difficulty is even more noticeable depending on your
        chosen character build. That’s because, so far as I can tell, playing
        with a Motivity (Lies of P’s equivalent to a strength stat) build is
        multitudes less difficult than speccing into Technique (its version of
        dexterity). As a Technique player, your weapons don’t do much to stagger
        enemies and your ability to block incoming damage is painfully limited,
        since you only fully negate a small percentage of the attack unless
        you’re able to pull off a perfect parry. In order to best the most
        formidable bosses, you’ll have to learn the enemy’s attack patterns and
        get down the precise timing required to perfectly parry most attacks
        before finally breaking the enemy’s guard and laying into them with your
        fast-moving weapons – a process that’s quite enjoyable, but also
        extremely unforgiving. Meanwhile, as a Motivity player, you can simply
        smack down bosses with your heavy weapons that do enormous stagger
        damage, leaving them wide open to deadly executions. That’s pretty
        hilarious to watch, but also feels pretty busted, especially compared to
        a significantly more demanding Technique-focused playthrough.
        <br /><br />
        Lies of P also just has some nice little quality-of-life improvements
        I’d like to see carry over into other soulslikes, like how you don’t
        lose all your Ergo (its version of souls) by dying, but rather have a
        certain amount deducted every time you take damage on your way to
        recover your lost currency; or how you’re notified whenever you’re
        carrying enough Ergo to level up your character instead of resting at a
        checkpoint, only to discover you need to kill one more enemy and come
        back. Little touches like that go a long way.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, Lies of P doesn’t manage to rid itself of the clunky
        roots of the genre completely, and I did encounter some fairly obnoxious
        bugs during my time with it. Among other things there were a few times
        where I phased through the environment in a weird way, and enemies have
        a weird habit of just despawning right in front of me like they were
        fading away during the season finale of a long-running high school TV
        drama. Thankfully, none of these issues were particularly widespread, so
        they’re unlikely to drag down an otherwise perfectly enjoyable
        adventure, especially since performance is otherwise rocksolid. I
        maintained a perfectly stable framerate at every point in my adventure,
        which isn’t a given in this genre.
        <br /><br />
        Also, many soulslikes are known for having memorable music, but Lies of
        P truly stands out in this regard. Not only are the tracks during boss
        fights great, but there are collectible vinyl records that you can play
        at a jukebox back at your base – and some of those songs are seriously
        just fantastic. So much, in fact, that it’s become a bit of an obsession
        to collect them all – and I’ve still got a lot of searching to do.
        Seriously, that jukebox made me find excuses to hang out at the social
        hub, crafting weapons and working on my build. It’s that good!
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Lies of P might not branch out particularly far from its soulslike
        inspiration, but like a marionette controlled by a skilled puppet
        master, it plays the part extremely well in a wonderfully dark fantasy
        world. It must be said that its uneven difficulty didn’t always make me
        feel like an underdog, especially when playing as a brawny, overpowered
        version of Pinocchio with a massive weapon, and combat pigeonholed me
        into a specific playstyle while the levels are less open and twisting
        than most. But with an awesome weapon crafting system, some really
        memorable boss fights, and one of the better stories we’ve seen in this
        genre, I can enthusiastically recommend you spend your time hanging out
        with Gepetto and friends. If you’ve been waiting for a Bloodborne
        remaster or sequel that may never come, Lies of P is the next best
        thing.
