      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        When it was first introduced a staggering 27 years ago, Mortal Kombat
        always had that reputation of being “That fighting game where you rip
        people’s heads off.” Known more for its gore and violence than its
        gameplay. Things have changed since then with MK9 and MKX bringing the
        quality of gameplay up to meet the quality of violence. That upward
        trend continues with Mortal Kombat 11, which is not only the best Mortal
        Kombat has ever been, it’s also arguably Netherrealm’s best game yet.
        This is one of the most fully featured fighting games you can buy, with
        both single- and multiplayer modes that will last both casual and
        hardcore audiences a long, long time.
        <br /><br />
        Mortal Kombat’s defining quality among 2D fighters is that its combat
        centers around two punch buttons, two kick buttons, and a block button.
        This is actually more unique than it sounds. While other 2D fighters
        typically have some combination of light, medium, and/or heavy attacks,
        with weaker attacks linking into stronger attacks, Mortal Kombat has no
        such concept. Instead, MK employs a “dial-a-combo” system that requires
        knowledge of very specific button combinations in order to build a
        combo. It’s definitely not a super-accessible combat system for
        newcomers, but fortunately, Mortal Kombat 11 comes with one of the best
        fighting game tutorials I’ve ever played. It covers everything from
        basic fundamentals all the way to the most advanced techniques such as
        frame traps, jailing, and block strings, all while highlighting key
        concepts and clear instructions on how to implement these techniques.
        <br /><br />
        Mortal Kombat 11 retains all of those unique mechanics that give this
        series its identity, and of course, the gloriously gratuitous
        over-the-top and often comedic violence of its notorious Fatality
        finishing moves. However, surrounding all of that are new fighting
        systems that feel unlike anything the series has ever seen, and Mortal
        Kombat 11 is much better for being willing to take these bold steps to
        keep things fresh.
      </p>
      <h2>In some ways, less is more, and faster is not always better.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In some ways, less is more, and faster is not always better. To that
        end, Netherrealm has slowed the action down substantially relative to
        the last few games, especially compared to the hyper-rushdown-focused
        Mortal Kombat X. The run button is gone, walk speeds have been reduced
        across the board, and super-far-reaching and forward-moving combo
        strings are much rarer. At first, I wasn’t a huge fan of how slow Mortal
        Kombat 11 felt, but the more time I put in, the more I started to
        appreciate how these seemingly small changes added up to change the flow
        of a match in a great way. With a greater emphasis placed on careful
        positioning and whiff punishing and less of a focus on all-out blitzing
        to impose your 50/50 mixup game, fights feel more tactical and rewarding
        of smart play.
        <br /><br />
        In another dramatic and inspired departure from previous games, Mortal
        Kombat 11 completely changes up how meter management works by splitting
        it in two. The defensive meter is used primarily for special wake-up
        options, environmental interactables, and a combo-breaking move called a
        breakaway. The offensive meter is used for amplifying your special moves
        to make them safe on block, increase their damage, open up combo
        opportunities, and more.
        <br /><br />
        The best thing about the split, though, is the fact that it allows Fatal
        Blows – a powerful move capable of doing 35% damage on its own – to
        exist independently of meter. Fatal Blows are often extremely fast and
        difficult to react to, but that’s balanced out by the fact that you only
        get one per match. If even one player has saved it, the closing moments
        of every close Mortal Kombat 11 fight feel extraordinarily tense –
        almost like an Old Western standoff.
        <br /><br />
        The best new addition to the actual fighting of Mortal Kombat 11,
        though, are Krushing Blows. These special critical hits activate
        automatically, but only when certain criteria are met: For example,
        every character has a Krushing Blow tied to their uppercut that will
        activate if it hits as a counter, or if it punishes a whiffed high
        attack. While uppercuts typically cannot be used as combo starters, if
        it is a Krushing Blow uppercut it will launch the opponent high up into
        the air and open them up to a substantial follow-up juggle without
        costing any meter.
        <br /><br />
        There’s so much to love about this mechanic, even on just the surface
        level of it being super satisfying to see an otherwise-normal punch
        cause a complete bone explosion inside your opponent’s body. On a higher
        level, though, the addition of Krushing Blows adds yet another level of
        depth to each character, and rewards a deep mastery of their moveset.
        It’s also a limited resource, because you can only use each move’s
        Krushing Blow once per match, so it’s a huge advantage to learn the
        requirements for each Krushing Blow to maximize their effectiveness.
      </p>

        The story's six hours are big, bombastic, and ridiculous in all of the
        right ways.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Netherrealm fighting games have always been the best at delivering story
        modes that are essentially the video game equivalent of absurd popcorn
        movies, and Mortal Kombat 11 is no exception to that rule. It has no new
        gameplay innovations to offer, but its six hours are big, bombastic,
        well-acted (other than Ronda’s Rousey’s portrayal of Sonya Blade, which
        comes across as woefully inexperienced), and ridiculous in all of the
        right ways. But most importantly, it fleshes out the entire roster and
        gives each character some time in the spotlight.The story picks up right
        where MKX left off (check out my handy Mortal Kombat story recap video
        to catch up before diving in) and quickly introduces a new game-changing
        character: Kronika, an all-powerful being with control over time who
        sets the plot down a path of another impending timeline reset, due to
        Raiden’s upsetting of the balance of good and evil with his decapitation
        of the Elder God Shinnok.
        <br /><br />
        This all sets up the fun scenario of a merging of past and present, and
        it allows for some truly great moments where characters from the present
        are confronted by their past selves. Also, there are some where
        characters from the past are confronted with the harsh reality of what’s
        in store in their future. The Johnny Cages steal the show with their
        witty banter and the overall juxtapositioning of their two wildly
        different selves, but there’s also a handful of fantastic
        character-building moments featuring fighters that have traditionally
        not had a ton of dedicated screen time, Jade especially.
        <br /><br />
        Mortal Kombat 11’s character customization feels like the natural and
        generally stellar evolution and cross-breeding of Mortal Kombat X’s
        variation system and Injustice 2’s gear system. The amount of
        customizable options for each character is utterly staggering, with each
        character having at least 60 skins, 90 pieces of customizable gear, and
        a selection of 10 techniques to add on to their core set of abilities.
        To be fair, most of the skins are simply recolors of the default
        outfits, but regardless, there are a ton of ways to make your fighter
        distinct when playing online. The problem is how you get access to them,
        which is generally not a great time.
      </p>
      <h2>

        staggering.

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Some of these items can be unlocked by playing through the story mode,
        but most are obtained through the Towers of Time and the Krypt, two
        modes that go hand in hand. Mortal Kombat 11’s Krypt, like those in
        previous Mortal Kombat games, is a sprawling dungeon filled to the brim
        with treasure chests that require some sort of currency to open. This
        time around the loot is randomized, which is a big problem because of
        the fact that there’s just so much undesirable loot. You may open up an
        expensive chest hoping to find a new Fatality, skin, character intro, or
        Brutality, and wind up with just a bunch of gear augments for a
        character you don’t use, junk tower consumables, concept art, or some
        extra currency. There are some cool puzzle-solving elements and neat
        Easter eggs to find in the Krypt, but it’s basically an explorable
        dungeon of lootboxes and occasional jump scares, and that’s a
        disappointment.
        <br /><br />
        Then there’s the Towers of Time, which is a collection of challenge
        towers unified by some sort of theme, and it’s in this mode that Mortal
        Kombat 11’s biggest problems lie. Some of the towers employ modifiers
        that make fights actively un-fun to play. Imagine trying to win a fight
        against an opponent who starts with twice your health, while also having
        to deal with a constant torrent of projectiles and assist characters. Or
        an opponent who will shock you for standing close to them for more than
        a second or two. It’s a challenge, yes, but one that’s more frustrating
        than fun.
        <br /><br />
        You’re able to use various consumables to give yourself a fighting
        chance, and they do make otherwise-impossible fights surmountable. But
        having to resort to miserable tactics, like projectile or consumable
        spamming, is frustrating, to say the least.
        <br /><br />
        Another issue lies in the character-specific towers, which are the best
        places to go for unlocking gear specifically for the character you like
        to play as. For whatever reason, certain challenge towers are blocked
        off until you perform some arbitrary and repetitive task, like hitting
        50 uppercuts, performing 50 Fatalities, or 75 Brutalities(!), which add
        nothing but a pointless obstacle. Completing the towers themselves
        already feels like grind, so to have to grind something else on top of
        that feels ridiculous. To make matters worse, the rewards are
        randomized, so you might not even get anything that would make the time
        or effort spent worth it.
      </p>
      <h2>Fortunately, not all towers are awful.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Fortunately, not all towers are awful. A few of the gimmicks are fun,
        like having to fight with the screen turning to black every few seconds,
        and these do a good job of breaking up the monotony of standard AI
        matches. And, since they refresh with new challenges regularly, you can
        always jump to a different tower if the one you’re stuck on sucks.
        <br /><br />
        Taking it Online
        <br /><br />
        With progression as deeply unsatisfying as it is, it’s the superb online
        mode that’s truly going to keep me coming back months from now. To start
        with the fundamentals, Mortal Kombat 11 has some of the best netcode
        I’ve ever experienced in a fighting game. Even matches against two-bar
        connections on wifi have very little, if any, noticeable lag, which is
        remarkable given how much other games have struggled under these
        conditions.
        <br /><br />
        All of the expected options are here: you can play ranked matches,
        casual matches, or King of the Hill, but you can also play weird AI
        matches where you pit a team of your own customized characters against
        someone else’s and watch them fight it out for rewards. You can enhance
        your fighters in this mode with special augments and even set their AI
        behavior, but there’s not much else to it outside of a way to keep
        Mortal Kombat 11 running and still earn some rewards.
        <br /><br />
        The way character customization is handled in ranked play is
        interesting. You’re able to set your cosmetics however you wish, but
        every character has two preset competitive variations that you must
        choose from. What’s weird is that these variations do not exist as
        premade variations anywhere but in competitive play, so it’s strange
        that you must actually go and create them yourself if you wish to
        practice with them. It’s also a bit of a bummer that you can’t customize
        your movesets in ranked play, especially since some of the best and most
        effective moves, like Scorpion’s Misery Blade, for instance, aren’t
        usable at all in ranked. Fortunately, the casual playlist allows you to
        use whatever you want, and unlike Injustice 2, there are no stat
        upgrades tied to gear, so everyone’s on an even playing field.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        It’s a rare fighting game that hits just about every note as strongly as
        Mortal Kombat 11 does. Everything from its methodical and deep combat to
        its fantastically absurd story mode and its rock-solid netcode, right
        down to its extraordinarily comprehensive tutorial is absolutely
        exceptional. It’s only when you get into its drawn-out progression that
        it trips up: the keys to unlocking Mortal Kombat 11’s rich vault of
        customization options are locked behind the frustratingly gimmicky and
        grindy barriers of the Krypt and Towers of Time. This series continues
        to prove that there’s real fighting depth beyond its notoriously gory
        Fatalities, and this one in particular stands out as a spine-ripping
        good time.
