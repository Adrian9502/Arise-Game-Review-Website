        Ara: History Untold, one of many games published by Xbox Game Studios,
        offers a remarkable take on strategy and empire building. PC gamers who
        appreciate strategy games like Civilization, Frostpunk, and others
        should keep a watch on this fantastic game. Here’s everything we have
        learned so far about Ara: History Untold.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Ara: History Untold?</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Ara: History Untold is a turn-based tactics game created by Oxide Games
        and published by Xbox Game Studios for the PC. The game’s premise is
        that you write your version of history, with different possibilities and
        events changing depending on how you evolve your Civilization. The most
        renowned creation by Oxide Games is Ashes of the Singularity, a
        real-time strategy game with unusually demanding hardware
        specifications. Several of Oxide Games’ founding members previously
        worked at Firaxis, the developer of the Civilization franchise, which is
        famous for delivering some of the best PC games on the market.
        <br /><br />
        This group is working with Xbox Game Studios, with numerous teams
        supporting the publication of various projects. Before the game was
        revealed, Jez Corden, an Xbox editor, shared the first information about
        it. Project Indus was the codename used at the time for unannounced Xbox
        games by both the internal and publishing divisions.
        <br /><br />
        “There have been many outstanding moments in history. Some famous, some
        forgotten by time. But what about the history that might have existed if
        you had invented it? What changes would you make to the world? What new
        tales would you share? Would you pay attention when your people speak?
        In this new world, how would you guide them? There have been many
        outstanding moments in history. But you’ll own these, “The narration
        provides details.
      </p>
      <h2>Gameplay information</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Ara: History Untold, a turn-based game, will foster detailed review and
        evolution, much like other games in the genre like Civilization. Each
        player will be allowed to lead a specific faction, and you can select
        from a pre-made list of leaders or design your own. So far, George
        Washington for the United States, Cleopatra for Egypt, and Sappho for
        the Greeks have been noted as potential leaders.
        <br /><br />
        The announcement trailer featured juxtapositions of fictitious events,
        including Asian emperors and Americans studying lightning together,
        pyramids built in a land of snow and ice, a statue constructed using a
        cutting-edge drone, and more. Ara: History Untold seems driven by the
        notion of “What might have been,” mixing up various historical
        hypotheses, factions, and settings for various combinations.
        <br /><br />
        Ara: History Untold, according to its founders, describes the “next
        evolution” of turn-based strategy games with infinite replayability.
        Players must gather resources, carefully construct cities, and, if
        necessary, engage in combat, just like in other turn-based strategy
        games.
      </p>
      <h2>Ara: History Untold: Release Date</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In light of this, the game was unveiled in June 2022 at the Xbox and
        Bethesda Games Showcase. This showcase was intended explicitly for Xbox
        players. Besides, it only included first- and third-party games
        currently scheduled to release by June 2023. Other notable first-party
        games from Bethesda Softworks and Xbox Game Studios Arkane Austin’s
        Redfall, Bethesda Game Studios’ Starfield, and Turn 10 Studios’ Forza
        Motorsport are planned for the same general release window.
        <br /><br />
        As a result, it is currently safe to assume that Ara: History Untold
        will debut before June 30, 2023. However, the game may be delayed as
        studios adapt to remote and hybrid work cultures. Delays continue to
        plague the gaming industry and have a lasting impact on game
        development. Ara: History Untold will enter PC Game Pass from the first
        release day, just like all Xbox first-party PC games. Naturally, it will
        also be sold on Steam and the Microsoft Store.
