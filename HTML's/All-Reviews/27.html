      <span class="author"> BY JARETT GREEN </span>
      <p>
        During the same year the first iPhone was released and Prince played
        Purple Rain at a halftime show where it literally rained, another bit of
        culture was changed forever: the first Assassin’s Creed was released to
        mixed reviews. Not everyone loved Ubisoft’s approach to stealth and
        action, but it was widely agreed that this game was on to something. In
        the 15-plus years since, its many sequels traded stealth for something
        far bigger and flashier, but lost sight of the very spirit of how it
        began. Assassin’s Creed Mirage takes a lot of important, imperfect steps
        to get back to its roots, and though that means as it does no particular
        thing that hasn’t been done before, the focus and commitment to briskly
        paced missions and stealth-heavy exploration scratches an itch that the
        RPG-based entries couldn’t reach. It might not be the most ambitious of
        games, but it does restore hope that there’s still room for a version of
        Assassin’s Creed that we haven't seen in almost a decade.
        <br /><br />
        Stealth is king again in Assassin's Creed. Mirage does away with the XP
        and leveling your character completely, meaning every enemy is just a
        hidden blade away from doom if you play your cards right. Most areas
        have lots of ways to stay hidden, and the returning eagle scouting
        option helps you check all angles before deciding your next move. It was
        refreshing to approach a scenario and have to weigh my options based on
        its many moving parts rather than simply considering if the loot is
        worth the mindless slaughter that will follow. Strongholds like
        high-security prisons and coastal fortresses regularly feature many
        guards with staggered patrols and overlapping sightlines. Early on
        especially, the threat of fighting multiple enemies at once is so
        daunting that using the shadows, sharp timing, and the environment is a
        necessity to make progress towards well defended objectives. Even more
        than in the pre-Origins games, I have had to make vigorous use of
        precariously hanging dock supplies or conveniently placed spice bags to
        cause enough chaos to see to my ends.
        <br /><br />
        Having played all of the DLC expansions for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, I
        admit I never once thought “I would like to know about the origin story
        for Basim,” the mysterious frenemy of Evior and Layla Hassan. I’ve now
        put almost 20 hours into learning his history as he takes the lead role
        in Mirage, and the story hasn’t really changed my mind on that front.
        Basim’s origins as a plucky cutpurse with a heart of gold turned
        vengeful assassin feels like the most fast-forwarded Hidden One’s story
        in the series. Before the blood from his slain friends dries, he’s
        trust-falling into hay stacks and chopping his own finger off. He’s a
        pretty milquetoast, golden retriever of a man, largely agreeable and
        affable when it comes to his interpersonal relationships, and chooses
        what’s right every time without much conflict. He’s fine, if not all
        that interesting most of the time, and by the end I was still left
        wondering how this guy became the scheming triple-crosser we met years
        ago.
        <br /><br />
        That said, Basim’s story is far shorter and more linear than those of
        the recent Witcher 3-inspired games, and for my dirham (that’s money)
        the adventure is better for it. Your main tasks start on the
        investigation board, a web of leads and clues that all point toward the
        main targets. Solving smaller issues, like identifying a local rebel
        leader or stopping a spree of abductions, often lead you to bigger
        reveals, which in turn take you further and further up the chain until
        you get to take another stab at the big conspiracy that's causing all
        this chaos. Admittedly, the board makes things feel more open ended than
        they truly are because you can tackle tasks in any order you like, even
        though they are almost all mandatory. But breaking the stories into
        little chunks that keep expectations clear and concise does wonders for
        the pacing of a game like this.
      </p>
      <h2>Basim’s story is far shorter, and the adventure is better for it.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Though it is more focused, Basim’s quest is pretty lackluster in
        relation to the other games in the series. The contrivance that gets him
        into the assassination game – revenge plus a calling to a higher purpose
        – has been done before and in more captivating ways in previous games.
        Save for maybe the final four or so hours, his hunt to track down
        members of the villainous Order of the Ancients is rather basic and
        predictable. Each of them and their flunkies are staunchly, almost
        cartoonishly evil without any nuance, and though it’s inoffensive to
        make the subject of your ruthless yet justifiable murders so simple,
        it's still a little disappointing that we haven’t had another big bad as
        complex as Haytham Kenway or as cackling mad as Rodrigo Borgia.
        <br /><br />
        The same goes for Basim’s allies, who are all various shades of
        “conspirators but for good” types you’ve seen all over the Assassin’s
        Creed series. With the exception of Basim’s own master Roshan, brought
        to life expertly by Shohreh Aghdashloo’s distinctively smoky voice, the
        supporting cast of Mirage is no more than adequate both as characters
        and in their performances.
        <br /><br />
        Among my favorite “characters,' though,' is the city of Baghdad and its
        surrounding areas. The different districts, from the dense bustling
        heart in the Round City to the dusty slums in Karkh, feel busy and
        lived-in in a way that hasn’t been present in the series since Unity or
        perhaps Syndicate. It’s full of busy streets full of people to blend in
        with and city blocks with open homes you can sprint through while
        eluding pursuers – things you’ll be doing a lot thanks to Mirage’s
        notoriety system. It’s in many ways a throwback to the Ezio days, and it
        scales up the efforts to take you down based on how many beehives you're
        kicking around town. Thanks to the iron grip that the ruling caliph has
        on the city, guards are on every corner and it gets very tough to escape
        their lines of sight simply by running. If you can’t hide, removing
        wanted posters and paying off town criers can help to clear your name.
        It asks a lot of you when it comes to evading capture, so it's nice that
        it also gives you lots of ways to meet its expectations.
        <br /><br />
        Not being a scholar, I can’t speak to whether Mirage’s many real-world
        locations are more historically accurate than past games (as the focus
        on finding historical sites seems more pronounced than in the recent
        past), but there’s no singular monuments or landscapes that really took
        my breath away like The Great Pyramids in Origins or Athena’s Statue in
        Odyssey. On the whole, though, the golden rolling dunes and tropical
        oases are beautiful and the city and its suburbs have plenty of alleys
        and nooks to explore if collectible hunting is your thing. Ubisoft’s
        renewed focus on a smaller region has allowed it to flesh out more of
        the details, and that’s a win.
        <br /><br />
        Your tools, which can be easily worked into combat but are invaluable
        during stealth, really shine in Mirage, especially when you upgrade them
        to increase effect ranges or have dramatic additional effects. My
        favorite dissolves the bodies of anyone I kill with a throwing knife,
        destroying all evidence of the deed. Realistic, no – but extremely
        useful. Basim also has a special stealth kill combo ability that
        functions almost like Deadeye in Red Dead Redemption, allowing you to
        mark a number of targets and kill them all in stylish and slightly
        bizarre fashion. This is great for clearing a room of guards that would
        be tricky to separate otherwise, or for taking down priority targets
        when an out and out fight will be unavoidable. It’s powerful, but
        balanced by the need to charge a special meter by performing quiet kills
        the old fashioned way, and that it can only be activated when you are
        anonymous.
        <br /><br />
        I wouldn’t say the locations you infiltrate here are better or more
        interesting than we’ve seen in recent years, though. If you’ve slunk
        through one hardened location in an Assassin’s Creed game, you’ll be
        well equipped for the sorts of hallways, underground docks, and
        fortified walls you’ll need to tackle here. Guards are still pretty easy
        to manipulate and lack basic self-preservation skills when spotting any
        uncovered corpses you leave behind.
      </p>
      <h2>Mirage takes some cues from stealth games like Hitman.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        I did appreciate that there were some new and returning ways to sneak
        into and soften up the fortifications. Bribing a merchant to let you
        pretend you are one of their helpers delivering goods was one of my
        favorite ways to saunter through a gate I wouldn’t be allowed in
        otherwise. In a later section, many different parties are congregating
        in the courtyard of a wealthy target’s manor, and helping a group of
        indentured people riot against their captor helped cause enough of a
        commotion to lure the big man into my blade. That sort of approach makes
        the world feel more alive and real, and takes cues from fellow stealth
        assassination games like Hitman.
        <br /><br />
        When I had no choice but to openly scrap, I found combat to be limited
        but challenging. Basim only has one combat style: using a sword and
        dagger to become a spinning dervish of death by weaving quick and heavy
        strikes together for short combos. You can switch between many types of
        swords and daggers, each having unique combat abilities you can mix and
        match, like a dagger that slows down time when you parry attacks or a
        sword that does more damage every time you strike with it in quick
        succession. I didn’t find the differences between weapon options to be
        so impactful that my playstyle changed around them, but I can see where
        some weapons, when fully upgraded and bestowing their biggest gifts,
        could be vital at a higher difficulty than the standard one. It’s the
        same story with your armor sets, which I almost never felt compelled to
        change for gameplay reasons, but frequently switched simply because
        Mirage’s line up of gear is a serve, fashion-wise.
        <br /><br />
        Combat is jarringly slower and more deliberate than we’ve become
        accustomed to, especially coming from Valhalla’s bevy of weapon types
        and special attacks, but I prefer Mirage’s heavy emphasis on counters
        and dodging incoming attacks, enforced by the sometimes erratic attack
        patterns from enemies mixed with the high damage they do in melee.
        Attackers don’t wait for their friends to be cut down before taking
        their turn to come at you, so you often need to avoid multiple swings at
        once – and engaging more than two or three guards at a time can be
        oppressive.
        <br /><br />
        There are very few enemy types: regular soldiers, bigger armored
        soldiers that can’t be damaged head on, and elite hunters who are sent
        for you when your notoriety is at its highest level. However, these all
        can vary slightly based on the weapons they have – a heavy soldier with
        a mace is a different sort of threat than one with a greatsword, for
        example, so you’d always have to be aware and adjust accordingly, and I
        never found myself wanting for new challenges. For as much of Mirage’s
        design feels like a callback to old eras of the series, combat feels
        like the biggest change that’s unique to this game, and it’s one I
        really liked.
        <br /><br />
        Mirage’s pared-down ability tree does have a much more dramatic impact
        on how you’ll want to play, though. Three branches – focused on killing,
        scouting, and gadgets – only have seven skills to unlock, but each one
        has big effects. Some simply help you do the things you can already do
        but better, like helping you eagle pinpoint objectives and targets
        faster. Some feel like features that existed by default in older games,
        like rolling over enemies to switch facing. I never regretted spending
        points on any one upgrade though, as they all made me better, but since
        you can respec all of these points at any time for free, you’re only
        ever a couple of minutes away from a new character build anyway.
      </p>

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s return to the stealthy style that launched
        this series doesn’t do everything right, but everything it does feels
        like it was done with purpose. This means a shorter game with a smaller
        map, fewer collectibles, smaller scope in combat, and a limited
        selection of gear to play with – all of which I found refreshing
        relative to the arguably bloated scale of 100-hour games like Odyssey
        and Valhalla. It also means an overly simplistic plot with mostly
        forgettable characters, but what the story lacks in depth it makes up
        for with its straightforward quest progression and fast pacing. Though
        there's no big standout “wow” moment, Baghdad is a beautiful location in
        its own right, and the world’s detail is focused inward, making every
        alley and hovel feel well traveled and full of detail and history. I’d
        recommend Mirage to anyone who’s lapsed on Assassin’s Creed, as its
        back-to-basics approach is a successful first step in returning the
        feeling that the earlier industry-defining games gave me so long ago.
