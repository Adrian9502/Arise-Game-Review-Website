      <p>
        I wish Remedy could make even more games, because Control reminded me of
        this studio’s knack for crafting engrossing, oddball worlds with an
        incredible sense of place. Control is perhaps Remedy’s weirdest yet,
        with the talking upside down pyramid who’s also your boss being about
        the sixth-strangest part. But thanks to sharp writing, a set of awesome
        and varied psychic combat abilities, and an impressively thought-out
        world, it was easy to wrap my head around what made this adventure tick.
        <br /><br />
        Infiltrating the Federal Bureau of Control as Jesse Faden and her blue
        wavy spirit buddy, I found myself fascinated. The Bureau’s headquarters
        seem like a drab, nondescript office building at first, and Jesse’s
        search for answers to events in her past were equally mundane. But
        Control quickly reveals what lies behind those concrete walls: within
        the first chapter I became both the janitor’s assistant and the new
        acting director of the Bureau.
        <br /><br />
        Jesse’s search is then sidetracked by solving everyone’s problems. And
        while taking over the bureaucracy of a federal institution may sound
        like a dull time, when it’s filled with as many weird and distinctive
        characters and overrun by an inter-dimensional force known as the Hiss,
        it rarely ever is in practice.
      </p>
      <h2>Mind Over Matter</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        As a kid who grew up on the X-Men, I’ve always wished I’d discover some
        latent psychic powers, or at least the ability to grow my fingernails
        super fast or something. Control’s lineup of moves is the closest I’ve
        gotten thus far to wielding supernatural abilities, and Remedy has made
        each of them fun to use. There’s enough variety for most of the 10-hour
        story campaign to make almost every move feel important.
        <br /><br />
        Jesse’s telekinesis is the best of the bunch. With a wave of her hand a
        crate, table, or ever-reliable chunk of concrete snaps to your side with
        satisfying urgency, followed by being hurled at foes and the
        destructible environment, with just as much of a thrilling zoom. I
        easily relied on this form of attack the most, and while it’s not quite
        the same level of tactile satisfaction as Kratos’ Leviathan axe in God
        of War, the oomph of hurling heavy objects around with my mind is as
        close as I’ve felt since.
        <br /><br />
        The other abilities aren’t quite as handy but mostly still fun to use.
        Late-game hovering allows for even more mobility, and Jesse’s shield is
        great when enemies with telekinesis of their own force you to go on the
        defensive. Control’s combat encourages constant movement, and finding
        cover is frequently necessary to survival, even if you have to summon it
        yourself. The standard difficulty level isn’t unfairly hard, but I died
        a fair number of times when I didn’t think to balance both offensive and
        defensive skills and got too cocky with jumping into the fray, for
        example. Getting up close and using the psionic wave force melee ability
        can be advantageous when you’re down to just a couple of foes, but
        anymore than that and short-range combat usually led to a swift death,
        in my experience.
      </p>
      <h2>Jesse's telekinesis is the best power of the bunch.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Instead, hanging back and finding a balance of when to strike and when
        to defend brings a nice rhythm to combat, and also lets you make good
        use of Jesse’s sole firearm – the Service Weapon. “Sole” is a bit of a
        misnomer, though, because the Service Weapon has several unlockable
        modes that shift it from a standard pistol to a fast-fire revolver to a
        more shotgun-esque spread shooter, and more. I eventually settled on the
        fun rhythm of the revolver and sniper-like pierce gun combo to keep
        enemies at bay for both short and long range.
        <br /><br />
        When it comes to enemy variety, however, Control doesn’t match the
        variation of Jesse’s combat options. The Hiss-controlled members of the
        Bureau who are now fighting against you, typically have one or two of
        your own moves and ammo options. It's fun to see how Control mixes and
        matches them in the early goings, but by the end of the story’s 10
        chapters there was little challenge to these encounters, other than
        fighting Control’s performance. When too many enemies were on screen
        firing at me and getting blown up by my explosives at any given time, I
        ran into some huge hitching issues – even on my PS4 Pro. They’d only
        persist for a few seconds, but those seconds are often crucial and led
        to frustrating deaths. Those were mitigated by Control’s forgiving
        checkpoint system, at least, and it hasn’t stopped me from continuing to
        explore the Oldest House – which is Control’s main setting and the
        headquarters of the Bureau – even after completing the story.
      </p>
      <h2>A House Divided</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Remedy has somehow made all of this gray concrete consistently
        fascinating. The Bureau is divided into a number of distinct business
        sectors, and though there’s certainly an overriding “corporate” theme,
        each area feels different enough that I wanted to know about the work
        being done there and how I could save it.
        <br /><br />
        And, thanks to the Oldest House’s ability to change its shape and
        internal structure at will, it can keep pulling the neat trick of
        rebuilding locations. It’s as if the paranatural forces at work treat
        cement and rebar like Lego bricks. It’s always impressive to watch how
        the various new sectors will conform to the nefarious presence and my
        attempts to stop it.
        <br /><br />
        The charm of the place comes, in part, from Control’s eclectic main
        cast. From Ahti, the janitor with serious Log Lady vibes, to Emily Pope,
        the information delivery service-slash-researcher – every character
        feels original and right at home in the Oldest House. Each sector brings
        with it a new character with a distinct, engaging personality, and yet
        they all absolutely made sense for someone who works in a secret
        government agency focused on paranatural forces beyond our
        understanding. In short, they’re all distinctive weirdos.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Remedy’s sharp writing extends from the dialogue into the collectibles
        and their descriptions or text. Control is not a story to just blaze
        through as you go — if you pick items up, you should absolutely take the
        time to examine and read them. They’re not only well written and
        frequently funny but often contain context that sheds new light on
        Jesse’s current point in the story.
        <br /><br />
        I could have done without some of the hokier thoughts from Jesse’s inner
        monologue, which often explicitly blurt out how she’s feeling rather
        than letting lead actress Courtney Hope’s strong performance convey that
        on its own. That said, there are enough winners (in which she often says
        what I was thinking) among those lines to make her constant asides worth
        it.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, alongside the main story, Jesse is pursuing a very personal
        goal as well, and she’s always looking to explore the Bureau for clues
        tied to her past. Without giving away why or what that translates into,
        I really enjoyed how Remedy tied Jesse’s personal story into the weirder
        corners of the Bureau through most of the journey.
        <br /><br />
        The ending of the 10-chapter story sadly doesn’t quite stick the
        landing, though, due in part to what felt like a bit of a rushed final
        chapter that left some of the most interesting aspects of Jesse’s
        personal stakes to be uncovered in collectibles. And the ending’s
        anticlimactic final moments don’t work nearly as well as the highs of
        the couple of chapters that precede it. That last-minute fumble
        certainly didn’t ruin Control for me, but Remedy lays such a solid
        foundation that I wished those final moments were as impactful as the
        rest of the story.
        <br /><br />
        Thankfully, there’s plenty left to explore in the Oldest House after the
        conclusion. Control’s fascinating cast have left me with plenty of side
        missions that offer fights more unique and fun than most of what’s in
        the main campaign, plenty more great dialogue, and a continued reason to
        explore every nook and cranny of the bureau. Add to that a host of
        kill-based objectives to earn crafting materials, the upgradeable
        Service Weapon forms and skill trees yet to fill out, along with the
        ever-present Bureau Alert side missions (timed opportunities to tackle
        extra objectives) and Control has conjured up plenty of reasons to stay
        on my mind.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Control is set in an engrossingly weird paranormal world that I couldn’t
        help but explore. Jesse’s versatile psychic skills and main weapon make
        for thrilling ranged combat. And thanks to a strong supporting cast, a
        well-written script, and plenty of intriguing breadcrumb trails, I’ve
        thoroughly enjoyed my adventure through the shifting rooms of Oldest
        House. Jesse’s personal story feels like an afterthought next to that,
        but there’s enough to Control’s world that I remain invested in
        uncovering every secret, even though the story’s over.
