      <p>
        A huge part of my teenage years were spend behind my PC playing Call of
        Duty and League of Legends, and after CoD Mobile convinced me that a
        shooter on mobile can work and be enjoyable, League of Legends Wild Rift
        shows me that even the MOBA I grew to have a love/hate relationship over
        the years plays awesome on mobile. This weekend I got the chance to test
        the game early in Europe, while being available already in other parts
        of the world, and enjoyed it so much that I honestly couldn't stop
        playing. I wanted to unlock all my favorite characters and get some
        skins for them through the free events, and before I knew it, I was
        hooked again. Playing League of Legends on a phone might seem like a bad
        idea, but it works so, so much better than expected.
        <br /><br />
        League of Legends Wild Rift is for the most part the pc version on the
        game, put on mobile, with a couple optimalisation options to streamline
        the experience. You won't use your mouse and keyboard, instead, you
        control your character with a thumbstick like feature on the left side
        of the screen, while your spells, items, summoner spells and other
        options are on the right. Controlling your character and throwing out
        spells needs some practice, since you cannot throw them out as fast as
        on PC, at least, without a lot of practice. After a couple games I
        noticed I was getting more comfortable with this, but throwing out an e
        first before I flash as Ahri to engage, seemed a bit too hard for me
        still. If you are an experienced LoL player you will pick-up on this
        more quickly than others it seems, and do most of your combo's
        succesfully.
        <br /><br />
        While I thought it would be really weird that my character would be
        controller this way, it felt natural quite quickly. League of Legends is
        a game that can be played on mobile and Wild Rift shows that. The better
        and more fluid version will always be the PC one, but I can't wait to
        play Wild Rift on the couch, train or during a lunch break at work. The
        game is well suited to play during the off time moments of the day.
        Especially since jumping into a game is really quick. While there is
        some ramp-up time on the PC version of the game, Wild Rift throws you
        into the game faster and also gives you tools to end the game quickly.
        The map is a bit smaller, while keeping the outlook of the original map
        and all jungle camps, and players get a constant stream of gold, just
        like in ARAM, to ramp up their power during the game. This means that
        the laning phase won't take long, and you'll all start fighting as soon
        as possible.
        <br /><br />
        At this moment not all champions are part of the Wild Rift roster, but I
        do like the champions Riot chose to be in the game for now. It seems
        that they picked the most popular champions for each lane, while
        presenting a roster which varries in playstyle. In the mid lane for
        example, you can choose for a control mage like Ziggs or Oriana, while
        also Ahri and Yassuo are available if you want to play as an Assassin.
        The same variety can be found in the other lane and jungle, and keeps
        room for other champions to be added. The first to that will join the
        Wild Rift, are Draven and Darius.
        <br /><br />
        Sad to say your progress from the PC version of the game won't carry
        over to Wild Rift, so your cool skins won't be available in both games.
        To compensate for this, Riot has a Rift to Rift event, which gives you a
        headstart on getting champions and skins for Wild Rift if you have
        played the PC version of the game before.
        <br /><br />
        I really enjoyed my time with League of Legends Wild Rift and can't wait
        to jump into the action again when the game goes into open beta on
        december 10th. While having played mostly Ahri during the test weekend,
        I want to grind and get Akali, as well as some Jungle champions.
        <br /><br />
        See you on the rift, Summoner!
