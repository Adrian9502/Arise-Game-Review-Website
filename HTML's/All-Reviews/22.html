      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        There’s an adage that the Dota 2 community often quotes when someone
        identifies themselves as a new player. “Welcome to Dota 2!” They say,
        with open arms, before concluding with, “You suck.” They're not wrong:
        for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much
        information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive
        players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding
        and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an
        achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous
        free-to-play model, and the great features developer Valve has built up
        around it.
        <br /><br />
        Valve's artists deserve praise for a crisp and readable style that,
        after some practice, makes it possible to tell what's going on even in a
        massive brawl where both teams of five colorful fantasy characters
        collide and cast spells at once. However, credit for the intimidatingly
        complex design of Dota 2 belongs to the original Defense of the Ancients
        mod (known as DOTA) for Warcraft III, which kicked off the MOBA genre.
        Valve (after hiring on DOTA's key developers) has copied that formula
        almost to the letter, and as a result Dota 2 has become notorious even
        among its MOBA peers for its difficulty – and that’s totally justified.
        It’s a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction
        and a world-class competitive game at the highest levels.
        <br /><br />
        As such, you should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or
        even your first week. That sounds like a cardinal sin of gaming, but
        there’s method to this madness. In short, Dota 2 is a deeply layered
        construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single
        one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to
        work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice
        of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and
        gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects
        of hundreds of complex abilities like Bloodseeker’s Rupture (which deals
        huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even
        figuring out which of the 102 heroes (and counting) fits you best is a
        time-consuming challenge.
        <br /><br />
        Initially, you’re thrown into the deep end to flounder, trying out any
        hero that makes the slightest bit of sense. The selection is
        bewildering: playing as Riki with his permanent invisibility from level
        6 on is an obvious choice, as it's hard to kill what you can't see. Drow
        Ranger, perhaps, with her obscene damage the instant she unlocks her
        "ultimate" ability at level 6, and her slowing Ice Arrows that enable
        both escapes and setting up a kill. On the more complex end of the
        spectrum you have choices like the armour-manipulating Templar Assassin,
        or the incredibly mobile Storm Spirit, who can dart around the
        battlefield and avoid damage by simply not being in the wrong place at
        the wrong time. On top of that there are well over 100 items to choose
        from within each game, each with their own ways of manipulating and
        enhancing your stats and suite of active abilities.
        <br /><br />
        Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes,
        and builds suit you best – you also have to adapt based on what other
        players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate
        with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his
        hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal
        Scroll to get home in a hurry.
        <br /><br />
        To grasp the subtleties of how heroes interact and fight you have to do
        more homework on the different kinds of damage and how they’re
        mitigated; how to prevent one type of spell from affecting you, and when
        you use that countermeasure; how the different kinds of aggro work, and
        when you need to manipulate them; the timers (which aren't made
        visible), and how to optimise your play around them.
        <br /><br />
        Even after all that, to avoid being caught at a disadvantage you must be
        taught the nuanced techniques that can make or break games, which Dota 2
        seems to almost belligerently hide from new players. Tricks like pulling
        a group of neutral monsters out of their home so that a new group can
        spawn to effectively double the rewards are never hinted at. This forced
        me to read and educate my outside of Dota 2, which had the positive
        effect of introducing me to the player community and making me feel like
        a part of it. It's almost like an oral tradition that binds together a
        tribe.
        <br /><br />
        This is a balancing system that could only exist in a game where
        everybody has access to all heroes, and Valve wisely obliges. All of
        Dota 2, including its growing cast of 102 characters, is available from
        the moment you complete the all-too-brief tutorial. And that delicate
        system can only survive if the items for sale have zero effect on
        gameplay.
        <br /><br />
        Again, Valve has come through. Only cosmetic enhancements, almost all of
        which are created by the community and held to a very high standard, and
        tournament goodies (such as tickets for viewing live events) are for
        sale. There’s not a single paid advantage that could have the slightest
        impact on the in-game balance, and that’s an amazing situation
        unrivalled among Dota 2’s closest competition.
        <br /><br />
        Pretty much everything I've praised Dota 2 for, outside of being totally
        free, is taken directly from the outstanding original mod. Where Valve
        has taken initiative to make Dota 2 a significantly better experience is
        in everything surrounding it, including improving the pre-game
        matchmaking interface, supporting the community of professional and avid
        players, and even allowing artists to create and sell cosmetic items on
        the Dota 2 store.
        <br /><br />
        Perhaps most important are the steps Valve has taken toward taming the
        hyper-competitive community. Besides matchmaking, guilds, and a wide
        variety of different game modes, the things that Valve hasn’t done are
        just as noticeable than the things it has. For example, there’s no
        concede button to throw in the towel on a losing match, and though you
        earn a matchmaking rank to ensure you're placed competitively, it's not
        visible to other players. If withholding those features seems like a bad
        idea on the surface, their sacrifice was not in vain – it prevents
        irritable players from dropping out of a match at the first sign of
        defeat, or when they're teamed up with people whose stats don't meet
        their exacting standards – a real frustration in other MOBAs.
        <br /><br />
        LIkewise, Valve recognized that less is more when it comes to
        unlockables. There’s no progression outside of the game that will have
        the slightest mechanical effect inside of it. Without artificial goals
        to aim for, the matches are left with a strong and refreshing sense of
        fairness and purity, where everything that can influence success or
        failure is right there on the battlefield and in your head.
        <br /><br />
        In my personal experience, Valve’s ideas work. I've played for over
        1,000 hours, and my encounters with people unwilling to act decently
        towards their fellow players have become increasingly rare over the
        course of Dota 2’s development. It has never been more friendly than it
        is now – though that’s a relative comparison. Even with these
        enhancements, the best way to play Dota 2 will always be with a team of
        four friends.
        <br /><br />
        Valve’s dogged desire to preserve DOTA's design perfectly is a
        double-edged sword in some ways. There are a few design choices that
        feel needlessly archaic and slavish to the original, such as the way
        Blink Dagger will arbitrarily shave 200 units of movement from your
        blink if you overestimate the distance, or how the towers will
        occasionally refuse to acknowledge your attempts to turn aggro away from
        yourself during a siege. They feel like relics of previous era,
        traditions carried on for the sake of tradition.
        <br /><br />
        As for its future prospects, things look bright for Dota 2. Each year of
        its long beta period is defined by huge balance patches that make
        widespread changes to keep things fresh and interesting. Given Valve’s
        excellent ongoing support of Team Fortress 2, its other free-to-play
        game, it’s a safe bet that there will always be something to learn and
        something new to master for the foreseeable future. Patches are released
        on a weekly basis, and on any given day there are multiple professional
        games to watch. Even the cosmetics are constantly changing, with
        community chests and themed events occurring regularly throughout the
        year. Dota 2 isn’t static in any sense of the word, from the wild
        variety of each game to the overarching sense that it will never be
        finished being made.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit
        you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment
        before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But
        once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety
        of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of
        knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s
        completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play
        games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere
        in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation
        is paramount. May the best team win.
