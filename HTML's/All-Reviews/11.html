      <p>
        A proper remake might be rising from the grave next year, but the
        festering corpse of Dead Space has come lurching back to life early in
        the form of The Callisto Protocol. This spiritual successor to the
        sci-fi survival horror series recreates the haunting blood-streaked
        hallways and space zombie-slaying hallmarks first established on the USG
        Ishimura back in 2008, and injects the gore with more awe than ever
        before thanks to some strikingly detailed splashes of blood and guts.
        Unfortunately, while the mutant dismemberment has never been more vivid,
        The Callisto Protocol’s shortcomings appear just as clearly. Occasional
        control annoyances, imbalanced combat, and a general absence of
        innovation result in a roughly eight-hour massacre that’s gratifyingly
        gruesome, but never quite as great as the series that inspired it.
        <br /><br />
        Catastrophe has struck the Black Iron Prison facility on the moon of
        Callisto, and the convicts are revolting; not just in the sense that
        they’ve escaped their cells and are causing a riot, but also because
        they’ve been infected by a mysterious virus that’s mutated them all into
        twisted toxic avengers. It’s up to wrongly incarcerated cargo pilot
        Jacob Lee to get to the root of the resident evil and find a way off the
        prison planet, undergoing a claustrophobic crawl through an
        exceptionally well realized facility in ruin and overrun by lunar-based
        lunatics. What follows is a fairly linear gauntlet run, but thankfully
        the team at developer Striking Distance Studios has proven itself to be
        masterful makers of creepy corridors – rarely are any two passages ever
        the same and each area is given a distinct sense of place, from the
        maintenance room decorated with dangling corpses that look like prison
        guard pinatas, to the frosted-over facilities that lie beyond the prison
        walls.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The Callisto Protocol's putrid penitentiary had me locked in a state of
        maximum insecurity.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Josh Duhamel from the Transformers movies does a commendable job in the
        lead role, as does The Boys’ Karen Fukuhara as his main ally Dani
        Nakamura, but the majority of the desperation and discomfort of the
        pair’s plight is conveyed through the impressive art direction and audio
        design. With the third-person camera tight on Jacob at all times, you
        get a clear look at the sweat sheen on his scalp in the humid laundry
        area, the blood-spatter that soaks his coveralls after each brutal
        encounter, and the especially icky sewerage that coats his body after
        he’s forced to wade waist-deep through waste management. Everything is
        thick and gross in a genuinely palpable way and reinforced by unsettling
        scrapes and sickening squelches in the darkness around you. And while
        it’s become a common technique for developers to mask the loading of new
        areas with the use of narrow gaps in the terrain for players to shimmy
        through, here they fortify the feeling of dread rather than becoming a
        drag. As Jacob inched his way through the disgusting pus-boil and
        tendril-covered caves of Black Iron’s lower levels, his winces on screen
        mirrored my own looks of unease. The Callisto Protocol's putrid
        penitentiary had me locked in a state of maximum insecurity.
      </p>
      <h2>Retread Space</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Let’s address the elephant-sized mutant monster in the room, though; The
        Callisto Protocol is effectively a Dead Space game in everything but
        name, with Striking Distance Studios even being lead by Dead Space
        co-creator Glen Schofield. From the neatly minimalistic HUD which grafts
        Jacob’s health bar into the back of his neck like a phone battery
        indicator, to the stomping of crates and corpses to uncover precious
        resources, to the combat system that heavily relies on a battery-powered
        telekinesis ability that allows you to hurl objects around with a flick
        of Jacob’s wrist. There’s even evidence of a mysterious religious cult
        that’s somehow involved in the outbreak, and instructions on how to kill
        enemies left in blood smeared on the walls. It stops short of
        introducing Isaac Clarke’s stasis ability, and swaps his collection of
        weaponised mining implements for a more conventional arsenal of pistols
        and shotguns, but it otherwise feels very familiar – and as someone
        who’s played all of the Dead Space games, it made for a campaign that
        was heavy on startling jump scares but light on any major story or
        gameplay surprises.
        <br /><br />
        The biggest deviation that The Callisto Protocol makes from Dead Space’s
        terror-fueled template is it’s increased emphasis on melee combat, at
        least during the opening hours. With weapons and ammunition initially
        scarce, dispatching each snarling cellmate demands that you lure them
        into an uncomfortably close proximity, sway out of the way of their
        clawing attacks, and then counter with a flurry of blows from Jacob’s
        stun baton. The thumbstick-based dodging and blocking of incoming
        attacks feels a bit like ducking and weaving in a boxing game – except
        your opponent is less like Holyfield and more like ‘Holy crap!’ – and it
        feels satisfyingly weighty to bash their limbs off one by one and
        bludgeon baton-shaped grooves into their skulls.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The already tight-in camera pulls even closer to really highlight the
        carnage as you administer each infected inmate with a lethal injection
        of hot lead.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Even as Jacob’s arsenal grows, melee combat remains a smart way to
        conserve ammo since each successful combo string you land opens up a
        brief window to perform a ‘skill shot’, allowing you to automatically
        lock-on to a weak spot with your firearm and down them in a few shots
        instead of a full clip. I enjoyed the risk-reward choice involved in
        getting up close and personal rather than trying to more safely pick
        enemies off from afar, not least because the already tight-in camera
        pulls even closer to really highlight the carnage as you administer each
        infected inmate with a lethal injection of hot lead.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately that high level of tension isn’t sustained once the GRP is
        introduced. Powerful enough to lift most enemies into the air, this
        gravity-defying gauntlet can certainly make for some dynamic combat
        encounters, particularly in tandem with the various deathtraps and
        volatile objects that are handily positioned around each area. You might
        enter a room full of ghouls, lift up one and impale him on a spiked
        wall, throw another into an exposed grinding mechanism, before finishing
        off a third by hurling a saw blade through their midsection, all before
        they’ve realised you were ever there. It can be a lot of fun in a
        jailbreaking Jedi sort of way and it often produces some gloriously gory
        results, but it also means that major threats are often too swiftly
        snuffed out, like you’re Indiana Jones bringing a gun to a swordfight.
        <br /><br />
        GRP is an ability that depletes and must either be recharged over time
        or instantly topped up with batteries should you have one in your
        inventory, so I couldn’t constantly use it as a crutch, but I certainly
        felt it gave me the force-flinging upper hand in the bulk of enemy
        encounters even on the ‘maximum security’ difficulty setting – at times
        making me wonder if the most dangerous monster lurking in Black Iron was
        actually me.
        <br /><br />
        The overpowered nature of the GRP meant I didn’t really bother investing
        too much in The Callisto Protocol’s weapon upgrade system. I certainly
        splurged on basic augmentations like expanded clip sizes and recoil
        dampening, but never felt the need to scrounge up enough Callisto
        credits to buy the more exotic enhancements. After all, what use are
        explosive rounds for the riot gun or the homing bullets for the assault
        rifle, when the ability to throw the ever-present explosive canisters or
        pick an enemy up and drop them over a ledge is the only alternate fire
        mode I ever really required?
        <br /><br />
        Similarly, stealth sequences fail to induce much in the way of stress.
        Midway through Jacob’s great escape The Callisto Protocol introduces a
        deadly blind variant of the infected that are reminiscent of the
        clickers from The Last of Us. However, although they’re purported to
        possess an elevated sense of hearing, I found it surprisingly easy to
        violently shiv them to death right under the nose of other enemies who
        seemingly wouldn’t bat an eyelid – assuming they have eyes – despite the
        loud death squeals of their freshly dispatched friends. A far more
        serious threat are the towering terminator-style security droids that
        can only be destroyed with a pinpoint headshot – mess it up and you’ll
        likely be swiftly minced by their high-powered canons – but strangely
        these genuinely formidable foes are introduced early on and then rarely
        encountered again.
      </p>
      <h2>Hell in a Cell</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        That’s not to say there isn’t a healthy variety of enemy types to tackle
        in The Callisto Protocol. Although they embody a fairly customary set of
        survival horror archetypes – standard zombie-types, suicide bombers that
        rush you, spider-like creatures that scramble on all fours up walls and
        along ceilings – they all look wonderfully repulsive, and even better
        when you’re making space jam out of their space guts. Before too long a
        regenerative ability is introduced that enables basic enemy grunts to
        transform into more resilient brutes if you wound them without finishing
        them off completely, which brings a welcome sense of urgency to fights
        with groups of agitated foes. This is perhaps best exemplified by a late
        game ride on an underground drilling platform, with hordes of attackers
        that set upon you from all sides and instantly power-up as a result of
        being lashed by the shards of flying rock. It’s definitely one of the
        most heartrate-ratcheting sequences of the entire journey.
        <br /><br />
        But elsewhere my anxiety was stirred by the surprisingly slow so-called
        ‘quick weapon swap’ function. It routinely let me down during the
        repeated fights against The Callisto Protocol's twin-headed tank-like
        mini-boss in which my ammunition reserves were rapidly drained. Tapping
        left on the D-pad swaps out one equipped weapon for another, but the
        animation of Jacob holstering a weapon and drawing the next is too long
        and can be accidentally interrupted, meaning there were many times I’d
        start a weapon switch but perform a dodge to evade an enemy attack
        immediately afterwards, and then spring back up into a shooting stance
        to find myself still armed with the exact same weapon I was attempting
        to holster. Clumsy control issues aside, The Callisto Protocol’s handful
        of boss fights are disappointingly one-dimensional and never really blew
        my mind (although they certainly smashed Jacob’s skull on a number of
        occasions).
        <br /><br />
        There are a number of other smaller quibbles that plague The Callisto
        Protocol. It’s frustrating that opening chests automatically picks up
        everything inside, meaning I had to continually hop into the inventory
        screen to drop the skunk gun ammo I never asked for in order to clear
        space. It seems a bit antiquated that you can only listen to audio logs
        while you’re standing still with your head stuck in a menu, instead of
        having them serve as eerie accompaniments to your exploration as they
        are in games like Dead Space and BioShock. And although having a
        facehugger leap out of the locker you’re searching might have been a
        great idea for a jump scare the first time, by the sixth or seventh time
        it’s just plain annoying, and feels like you’re being forced to endure
        the same repeated office pranks of an alien April Fool’s day.
        <br /><br />
        Lastly, while its eight-hour runtime feels about right in terms of
        pacing, there’s precious little to do in The Callisto Protocol after
        you’ve beaten the story. While a New Game+ mode is apparently coming via
        a free patch at a later date, for now there are no interesting
        unlockables to speak of that might encourage repeat playthroughs, or any
        alternative modes to try, making the overall package at launch feel
        almost as slim as a prison cell mattress.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        The Callisto Protocol is a supremely atmospheric and action-heavy tour
        through a spectacular slaughterhouse set in distant space. Its largely
        linear design makes for minimal backtracking, meaning it trims the fat
        while leaving no shortage of bone and gristle to rip and tear. However,
        it also betrays its survival horror roots by regularly tipping the
        balance of power too far in favour of the player, and while there’s
        plenty of murderous fun to be had using giant grinding mechanisms to
        make mulch out of mutants, such cheap thrills come at the high cost of
        puncturing any tension and dread that the tremendous art and audio
        design work so hard to invoke. Aside from the meaty melee combat,
        there’s also the overriding sense that there’s not a lot here that
        hasn’t been done before – and there’s disappointingly little to do once
        you’ve beaten the campaign. Thus The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly
        gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it’s ultimately
        more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation.
