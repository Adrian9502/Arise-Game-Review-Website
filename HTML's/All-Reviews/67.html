      <p>
        With a sophisticated setting built to accommodate classic RPG mechanics
        we don’t see often enough in modern games, Prey feels both new and
        nostalgic at once. A wonderfully explorable science-fiction environment
        proves dense with interactive systems, intrigue, and ever-present
        danger. And even though combat’s only slightly preferable to the weak
        stealth options, I was a little surprised at how quickly my time-played
        clock seemed to tick toward 40 hours before I reached the end.
        <br /><br />
        The first hours of Prey are enticing, with a mind-bending psychological
        opening scene that foreshadows a story more interesting than what the
        main plot ends up being. It’s fairly strong nevertheless, with some
        interesting implications and a few surprising characters who keep things
        moving along during dozens of hours of exploration. Its twist on the
        typical amnesiac protagonist premise prompted me to question everything
        I was told as I roamed the enormous and fascinatingly anachronistic
        space station, Talos I.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Arkane has done a fantastic job of making this bizarre place feel
        lived-in.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The most interesting stories were the smaller ones I came across, those
        of the people who lived on Talos before, during, and after it was
        attacked by aliens. Between terminals containing all sorts of emails,
        well-acted audio logs, and thoughtful environmental storytelling,
        developer Arkane has done a fantastic job of making this bizarre place
        feel lived-in long before I ever met another living human. There’s so
        much storytelling treasure to uncover here, ranging from squabbles among
        co-workers to more personal notes like a scrapped proposal speech,
        Dungeons & Dragons character sheets, and even hilariously terrible
        in-universe science-fiction novel snippets.
        <br /><br />
        It’s an impressively fleshed-out universe, built around an alternate
        history of the space race that somehow led to an elaborate orbital
        station, complete with artificial gravity, where touchscreen computers
        exist side by side with film projectors and rotary telephones. I enjoyed
        uncovering how that history unfolded in bits and pieces gleaned from
        news articles and tidbits on the brief loading screens. That, combined
        with being rewarded for picking up literally any piece of useful gear or
        actual trash thanks to a cartoonish recycling system that lets you turn
        even old banana peels into raw materials for manufacturing weapons and
        upgrades, made me eager to turn over every metaphorical rock on Talos.
        <br /><br />
        Which is devious, because some of those inanimate objects are actually
        disguised facehugger-style aliens who will surprise you by abruptly
        revealing themselves when you get close and trying to eat your face off.
        The presence of these mimics, as they’re known, gives all of that
        exploration a looming sense of paranoia: you have to question why
        objects are placed where they are, which works because just about
        everything on Talos is meticulously laid out in a way that, for the most
        part, makes sense. It sets all kinds of cruel traps for you, such as
        when one of what appears to be a pair of much-needed health packs
        actually turns out to be a predator lying in wait for wounded prey. The
        jump scares did get old after a while, but I never stopped feeling the
        tingling sense of tension upon entering a new room.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Prey follows closely in the footsteps of System Shock 2 and the original
        Deus Ex.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Mechanically, Prey follows closely in the footsteps of classic
        first-person RPGs like System Shock 2 and the original Deus Ex, and puts
        some of their best ideas to good use. There’s complex character
        development along six different skill trees, plus modular upgrade
        systems for both your space suit and your scope. With all of those
        options and not enough upgrade items to go around, there are enough
        meaningful decisions to make your version of Dr. Morgan Yu (who,
        notably, can be either a man or a woman according to your whim) feel
        like your own, and tailored to your playstyle. Equipping the
        mimic-detecting scope upgrade, for instance, let me change up the task
        of sweeping a room before it became tedious. Prey can take a bit too
        long to get to the good stuff, though – the psychic power options didn’t
        open up for me until I was more than 10 hours in, and I never saw any
        suit mods until even later than that.
        <br /><br />
        Most of the abilities themselves don’t feel like much of anything
        special, as things like enhanced strength, repair skill, the ability to
        move objects or kill with your mind, and even resurrect the dead to
        fight for you have all appeared in plenty of games lately. What makes
        Prey feel more distinct is the flexible, semi-open-world level design
        that allows you to reach objectives by different paths, depending on
        your strengths. (Granted, that’s also shown up in recent Deus Ex and
        Dishonored games, though not on this style of open map.) One character
        build might look for opportunities to hack into computer terminals to
        bypass locked doors, while another would use brute force to open doors
        or remove barricades, and still others might just search the environment
        until they find the passcode written carelessly on a post-it note
        somewhere. Even though I didn’t have all the abilities I needed to
        exploit them, it’s fun just to try to spot all the ways into a locked
        room and appreciate the thought that went into designing these puzzles.
        Plus, it’s a pleasant surprise that you’re able to move and climb so
        nimbly in general, and moreso when it’s upgraded, letting you reach some
        out-of-the-way places and further encouraging exploration.
      </p>
      <h2>
        I usually had unlocked new abilities that let me access new nooks and
        crannies.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Your main quest – and the many side quests that can extend the life of
        Prey from a 15 to 20-hour run to something more on the order of 40 or 50
        – will send you back and forth across the same moderately varied zones
        repeatedly. I didn’t get tired of seeing the arboretum, the cargo bay,
        the lobby, the crew quarters, or any of the others, though, because I
        usually had unlocked new abilities that let me access new nooks and
        crannies since the last time I’d been there. I did, however, get a
        little sick of trying to find my way around the outside of the station.
        It’s the closest thing to a fast-travel system Prey has, but it’s
        annoyingly tough to figure out where the right airlock is, especially
        since there’s no “up” in the zero-G environment.
        <br /><br />
        When I finally encountered some living, breathing humans and heard about
        their predicaments, at first I was disappointed at the lack of dialogue
        options to decide what the outcome of those quests would be. But then I
        realized that Prey’s approach is more novel: you’re given a task, such
        as saving someone or killing them, and your actions determine your moral
        position. Do you save a group of people under attack or leave them for
        dead? Do you take revenge on the man who killed a survivor’s partner or
        let him live? Do you kill mind-controlled humans or find a way to free
        them? It’s an interesting and more subtle yet more active approach than
        simply stating whether you’re good or bad. It’s nice to see actions
        speak louder than words when it comes to RPG morality, and those choices
        were satisfyingly – if somewhat bluntly – recognized in the ending.
        Without spoiling anything, I found the final reveal slightly deflating,
        but the setup for where the story could go next has great potential.
        <br /><br />
        All of the detail put into the environments and storytelling goes a long
        way to compensate for the fact that Prey isn’t exactly the best looking
        game out there. It only occasionally looks bad, such as when characters
        other than the handful of main allies move their mouths, but most of the
        time it makes the most of its sometimes flat-looking textures to make
        its zones appealing. Creature design, on the other hand, is one-note.
        All of the aliens are made of the same black goo, which, while creepy
        when moving through the shadows, doesn’t hold up in the long run. Some
        of the larger aliens are just weird-looking blobs, and the robot enemies
        are all built on the same floating PC tower-like chassis.
      </p>
      <h2>Combat turns out to be Prey’s biggest weakness.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The act of fighting them, and turrets around the station once they
        decide you’re a threat, turns out to be Prey’s biggest weakness. Combat
        is fine, for the most part; the main weapons are a very typical pistol
        and a shotgun, with a couple of other similarly uninteresting high-tech
        options thrown in. Even when mental abilities such as creating copies of
        yourself or planting flame mines get involved these fights have nothing
        approaching the bloody, supernatural acrobatics of Arkane’s other
        current series, Dishonored. Most enemies are as bullet-spongy as their
        gooey look implies, especially before you max out your damage upgrades
        on both your character and your weapons, and ammo is scarce. That led to
        some tense standoffs where I was left trying to fend off aliens with my
        lowly wrench melee attack, but that lasted only until I unlocked the
        mind-control power that immediately renders even the biggest and
        fiercest enemies docile long enough for you to bludgeon them into
        puddles of goo. It became a chore long before the time the
        save-corruption issues declared my game over, and I’d mostly switched to
        Jedi mind-tricking my way past most fights. This isn’t the squishy human
        you’re looking for.
        <br /><br />
        You could, of course, stealth your way past most, if not all of the
        enemies out there by distracting them with thrown objects (or the goofy
        knock-off Nerf gun), but Prey isn’t interesting as a stealth game. There
        are no attempts to detect you other than randomly patrolling aliens, and
        no alarms raised if they do find you. Meanwhile, the only significant
        power that seems geared toward stealth is the ability you swipe from the
        mimics to transform into any small object, which effectively makes you
        invisible as long as you’re holding still (until your psych power meter
        runs out). That, as it turns out, is the least-useful application of
        that power. Prey is workable as a stealth game, but barebones enough
        that I generally opted to fight instead.
      </p>
      <h2>
        You’d think the ability to turn into literal pieces of trash would let
        you play hilarious pranks.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        More disappointingly for a systems-based game with such strong
        connections to Deus Ex and Dishonored, the enemy AI isn’t reactive or
        curious-seeming enough to make them fun to mess with using your powers.
        For instance, you’d think the ability to turn into any inanimate object,
        such as literal pieces of trash like banana peels or bio-waste bags,
        would let you play hilarious pranks on enemies and get funny reactions.
        But none of these creatures – including the rare humans you come across
        – react any differently to a strangely placed chair than they do to a
        valuable item. You’re either ignored completely or discovered and
        attacked without a word (because the aliens don’t talk), so it feels
        like I’m telling a joke that nobody’s around to hear.
        <br /><br />
        I did have fun messing with the innovative Gloo Cannon, which launches
        blobs of instantly hardening foam to very briefly immobilize enemies,
        clog holes, or create platforms. Its ability to create staircases had me
        thinking outside the usual box here and there, but it’s nowhere near as
        full of possibility as a Portal Gun or Gravity Gun when it comes to
        solving puzzles. You can’t, for example, build towers of goo on top of
        goo, so your ability to build Minecraft-like structures is limited.
        <br /><br />
        The biggest bugs I’ve encountered since the patch are small annoyances.
        Some of the most common items you pick up – alien organs and spare parts
        – often fail to stack properly in the screen inventory, which causes a
        needless hassle when your slots fill prematurely. Oh, and one time I was
        launched into space through a wall while passing through an anti-gravity
        field and had to reload an autosave (which is generally pretty good at
        saving frequently). But none of that ever did much more than slow me
        down for a few moments.
        <br /><br />
        Controls feel good on mouse and keyboard, but with a gamepad the first
        thing you’ll want to do is turn the sensitivity up – otherwise,
        constantly turning to face mimics that jump behind you gets frustrating
        quickly. Load times trend a little on the long side on consoles, though,
        and we’ve inconsistently seen some minor input lag on the PS4 that took
        some time to get used to. And if you’re a PS4 Pro owner, unfortunately
        there aren’t currently any enhancements in resolution or frame rate.
        It’s 30 frames per second on console and uncapped on PC, where it runs
        beautifully aside from the first time I visited the reactor, but that
        was easily fixed by a restart.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Prey’s curious alternate-history universe, intriguing sidequests, hidden
        threats, and detailed environmental storytelling make Talos I a joy to
        explore. The unsettling sense of paranoia that comes from knowing any
        object could turn out to be a hidden enemy gives even the quiet moments
        a palpable tension. All of that picks up the slack for combat and
        stealth that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout what can
        be a long game.
