      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        With Party Animals, developer Recreate Games takes the goofy joy of
        floppy, physics-based multiplayer games like Fall Guys, Gang Beasts, and
        Human: Fall Flat and puts its own spin on them. Instead of falling in
        with the rank and file, Party Animals pushes the genre forward thanks to
        a thoughtful attention to detail, creative levels, and its engaging,
        comedic showdowns, though it does stumble over its inflexible rules and
        local multiplayer mishaps.
        <br /><br />
        You’ll take control of an adorable, clumsy animal with a powerful right
        hook as you join up to seven other players in punching, dropkicking,
        headbutting, and flopping your way to victory in a variety of different
        challenges. Their wobbly animations cause a sticky,
        moving-through-molasses-like feel to the controls that might be a
        turn-off at first, but after a few rounds it clicks. Doing just about
        anything – including walking – has a short wind-up, but the delay
        eventually becomes satisfying as you watch your party animal launch
        itself into motion. It feels intentional, and contributes to Party
        Animals’ overall loose sense of combative chaos.
        <br /><br />
        Attacks all have a similarly long wind-up that contributes to the
        ragdoll nature of your chosen combatant, but when a blow connects, it
        feels less like a plush pawing from a stuffed animal and more like a
        powerful pound from a heavyweight boxer. Time even temporarily slows
        down to really emphasize the impact of a particularly potent punch
        before your cute little guy goes flying.
      </p>
      <h2>
        When a blow connects, it feels like a powerful pound from a heavyweight
        boxer.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        With three modes, each with its own set of maps, there’s a lot to sink
        your teeth into here. The main one is Last Stand, which distills Party
        Animals to its purest, most chaotic form. Each of the nine maps feels
        relatively small, but they are perfectly sized to house eight-player,
        every-animal-for-themselves bedlam. They all present you with distinct,
        clever environmental challenges to overcome and/or throw your opponent
        into, from a cracking ice float to a high-speed wind tunnel. Weapons
        appear in all three modes but are most useful in Last Stand because here
        KOs are prioritized above all else.
        <br /><br />
        Those weapons include giant lollipops, crossbows, tasers, nunchucks, and
        toilet plungers among others, and they rain down from the sky to help
        whichever lucky animal picks them up wreak even more havoc. My favorites
        are the bomb, which can be lit and tossed into the middle of a cluster
        of critters like something right out of a Looney Toons cartoon, and the
        nunchucks, which are a chaotic pickup that deals heavy damage very
        quickly but might also smack you in the face.
        <br /><br />
        As players get whittled away things can start to slow down, but most of
        Last Stand’s maps ensure that rounds never drag on much longer than
        three or four minutes on average, as it becomes more difficult to
        survive as time stretches on. Maybe the rope bridge you’re fighting on
        suddenly falls sideways, or perhaps the levers that you use to defend
        yourself from a wild tunnel’s gale snap off, leaving you to get swept
        away.
      </p>
      <h2>I’ve even seen a KO'd player determine the outcome of a match.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        True, it’s a drag to be KO’d early and have to spectate until the next
        match, but you can fling increasingly powerful items like fish, banana
        peels, and bombs onto the battlefield after getting knocked out, which
        keeps everyone engaged. On a few occasions, I’ve even seen a projectile
        from a knocked-out player determine the outcome of an entire match.
        <br /><br />
        The second mode, Team Score, splits its eight maps in half. Four are
        variations on different sports like basketball, soccer, hockey, and
        American football. They’re all fun party modes, but they’re not
        particularly interesting or novel. The non-sports maps, on the other
        hand, all come with their own unique mechanics that run the gamut of
        playstyles. In one, you have to carry big chunks of coal to the front of
        a train to push your team’s locomotive ahead of the other. In another,
        you’ll launch explosives (and your teammates) across a river into your
        opponents’ base. Most of them also allow you to sabotage your opponents,
        adding a welcome layer of chaos to the competition that keeps you from
        falling into a repetitive rut. Almost every single map introduces new
        ways to reward you for understanding Party Animals’ floppy controls
        without leaving new or unskilled players in the dust.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Throwing your opponent down onto the tracks before a train comes is
        really fun.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Finally there’s Arcade Mode, which is entertaining, but is overshadowed
        by the others thanks to its relatively small list of just two maps. It’s
        also very similar to Last Stand; the levels in both modes feature
        similar mechanics and design philosophies while avoiding the
        custom-built challenges and objectives found in Team Score. The only
        real difference is that Arcade puts you into two teams of four with 10
        lives shared between them. That similarity is a little disappointing,
        but Arcade Mode does have my favorite map in Party Animals: Final
        Destination, where you’re fighting for control of a subway platform.
        Throwing your opponent down onto the tracks before a train comes is
        really fun and makes for some tense moments.
        <br /><br />
        It’s so amusing, in fact, it makes me wish I could play it more
        consistently or in other modes! But because Arcade Mode only makes up
        two of the 20 total maps in Party Animals, the online matchmaking that
        seems to pull randomly from the overall pool causes it to come up a lot
        less often than Last Stand and Team Score. It would be nice if Party
        Animals included a playlist system that let players opt into whichever
        modes or maps they like the most.
        <br /><br />
        One thing that sets Party Animals apart from other similar games is that
        it supports up to eight players, but that bigger scope can also kill a
        small party’s vibe; while I spent the majority of my time playing in
        full lobbies, playing with smaller groups uncovered some confusing
        rigidity beneath the surface. Where other party games have dozens of
        options to customize rules like item spawn rate and score limits, Party
        Animals does not. It’s missing the elasticity that makes a great party
        game replayable for years on end.
        <br /><br />
        This problem is at its worst in Team Score mode, where you can’t modify
        things like score limits or the arbitrary timer that pops up whenever a
        team goes a certain amount of time without scoring a point. Playing with
        people who don’t follow a map’s specific objective or who aren’t
        familiar with Party Animals’ controls will result in matches that drag
        on because each map and game mode is designed in very narrow ways that
        don’t accommodate doing something the developers didn’t necessarily
        expect.
      </p>
      <h2>
        I felt discouraged from playing multiplayer locally rather than online.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Local Multiplayer is similarly stymied by some eyebrow-raising
        decisions. Mainly, you’re forced into four-way split-screen (causing
        frame rate slowdowns on my PC) with a clumsy camera when it seems as
        though a fixed view of the whole map would work better. I felt
        discouraged from playing locally with my roommates or inviting friends
        over to play a few rounds rather than just playing with them online. In
        2023, it’s frustratingly common for a party game to force local
        multiplayer into the backseat – here it’s even hidden within the online
        multiplayer menu – but it is always disappointing.
        <br /><br />
        These issues, though minor, point to where Party Animals needs some
        post-launch love and care. I could very easily see a patch or update
        fixing a majority of them, and it seems like Recreate Games at least
        intends to support this fluffy mayhem for some time to come. For
        example, there’s a full item shop where you can spend in-game currency,
        a progression system, and a locker system that you might expect from a
        live-service game.
        <br /><br />
        It’s impossible to bring up Party Animals’ item shop without gushing
        about the adorable cosmetics you can unlock. Almost every character has
        a variety of cute costumes that range from cheeky nods to pop culture,
        like an aviator jacket for a goose, to just plain charming digs that
        make a tiger look like a champion fighter. They don’t change gameplay
        whatsoever, they’re just there to look cute.
        <br /><br />
        The version I played had everything unlocked already, but you’ll need to
        earn in-game currencies to unlock a legally distinct Darth Vader
        lookalike costume for your duck or a samurai costume for the Shiba Inu.
        It’s hard to say for sure ahead of launch, but between the Fortnite-like
        shop and the ways Party Animals’ multiple currencies are displayed, I
        have a feeling you’ll be able to buy in-game currency if you’d like to
        unlock a specific costume. (There’s also a blind capsule machine where
        you can buy random items.) That’s largely par for the course in a modern
        multiplayer game, but at least here you do earn currency, skins, and
        opportunities to use the capsule machine as you play.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        With smooth online multiplayer, a handful of mostly distinct maps, and
        downright adorable characters, Party Animals delivers a fun party game
        that brings cuddly, chaotic fun where it counts the most. The
        intentionally wobbly controls take a moment to get used to, but once you
        do it’s wonderfully satisfying to land a punch and send another player
        flying into an environmental hazard for a KO. It does commit an
        all-too-common cardinal sin for contemporary multiplayer games in making
        local play less enjoyable than going online, but all three main modes
        are a good time, especially in a full lobby of eight players.
