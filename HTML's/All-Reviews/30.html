      <span class="author"> BY TIM SMITH </span>
      <p>
        Dead Island is Fallout 3 with zombies. Plenty of people are going to
        compare it to Dead Rising (as you can create weapons) and Left 4 Dead
        (as the action is first-person and good for four players online), but
        when I finally got past the game's obtuse opening and less than stellar
        cutscenes, I found a world rife with quests, interesting environments,
        and a character progression system that had me begging for more hours in
        the day. In short, Dead Island's a rough around the edges role-playing
        game, and I dug it.
        <br /><br />
        On a small island off the coast of Papua New Guinea, the dead walk. The
        story didn't set my hair on fire, but everything else makes up for it.
        When you sit down to play, you'll choose one of four characters and for
        the next 20 to 30-some hours roam massive maps, take on interesting side
        quests, and chop the heads off hundreds of ghouls.
        <br /><br />
        But Dead Island doesn't succeed because of its gore (though I liked the
        dismemberment). Dead Island's strength is in the world it creates. I
        crept into and through each environment I came to, from beaches to
        sewers to jail cells. I listened for the screams of the infected or the
        roar of a damage sponge known as a "Thug." From that perspective, I was
        on the island; not my character. In the beginning, I'd slaughter every
        zombie I saw, but by the time I got to the city and found tight
        alleyways overrun with monsters, I began to just run from objective to
        objective. No longer was I playing a game -- I was focusing on survival
        as if I were the one running from Point A to Point B.
        <br /><br />
        Objectively speaking -- like, right now from my keyboard and not playing
        the actual game -- that's a stupid thing to say. Dead Island doesn't
        really punish you for dying. If you croak, you wait five seconds and
        respawn with less money. Any damage you inflicted before heading to the
        great beyond remains. But I say that using hindsight. When I sprinted
        away from a zombie and heard its growls directly behind me, my heart
        pounded in my chest. I didn't think "Oh, I'll just let him get me and
        restart back there."
        <br /><br />
        You rarely feel safe in Dead Island, and that's how a zombie game should
        be. You have a limited stamina bar, so you can't run or swing your
        weapon forever. Med kits were few and far between in my experience, so
        scavenging for energy drinks and fruit -- which have to be used at that
        moment and can't be stored -- became part of the experience. Weapons
        degrade as you use them, so finding a "legendary" weapon was exciting,
        but not as exciting as finding a workbench to keep weapons in tip-top
        shape.
        <br /><br />
        Dead Island made me my character. I chose the weapons, the enemies to
        attack, and the side quests to take. When I leveled up, I chose in which
        skill tree to invest my new point in -- so even if you joined my game as
        the same knives expert I play as, we wouldn't necessarily have the same
        abilities.
        <br /><br />
        Thankfully, joining games is easy. When you're playing, a pop-up message
        will notify you if a player is close to you and joinable. If I see you
        sign on, I can invite you in. Of course, experience levels play into
        this. Players can only join the games of people who are equal or lesser
        levels. I can't be level 31 and about to win the game and have a level 1
        player join me. It might sound depressing, but there are tons of
        character slots, so having a character for different sessions shouldn't
        be too tough. Plus, you can always switch your game to single-player if
        you just want to be left alone. Sadly, there is no local co-op.
        <br /><br />
        Is Dead Island perfect? No. Far from it. As much as I lauded it, Dead
        Island is rough around the edges and that's sure to turn a lot of people
        off. First-person melee combat doesn't feel natural right away.
        Sometimes textures take their time loading in, I'd describe every
        cutscene as "stiff," and the visual flaws like hands going through doors
        and weird mini-game meters made me laugh. Still, presentation doesn't
        make a game, experiences do. And they are packed into Dead Island.
        <br /><br />
        Pretend that We're Dead
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Dead Island probably won't win any game of the year awards. It's got
        visual bugs, the controls take a bit to feel normal, and the
        presentation in general isn't up to snuff. But the game gets a lot
        right. There is a huge world to explore, thousands of zombies to kill,
        and tons of side quests to take. Here on the other side of a 25-hour
        playthrough -- where I skipped a lot of side quests after Act 1 -- I'm
        anxious to get back into Dead Island, and despite the game's flaws,
        that's not something I say often.
