      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        You are Alex Mercer. What exactly that means is initially unclear
        because this is a man who has lost his memory, but awoken in a morgue to
        a world in which he possesses untold power. A viral outbreak has claimed
        Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected
        citizens are undergoing radical, monstrous changes -- none more drastic
        than Alex himself. This anti-hero finds himself with the ability to
        shape shift and absorb other beings. As the most powerful being on a
        closed island, the entire city is your playground. And it is a game
        world that feels unfinished.
        <br /><br />
        Prototype is a single player, open-world action game in the style of
        Crackdown or The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. You play as a
        man gifted with superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you
        like and do most anything you want once you get there. It's sandbox
        gaming with a heavy focus on pure action.
        <br /><br />
        Though you play as a man bestowed with superhero power, Mercer is
        anything but heroic. There are no moral choices here. Mercer has vowed
        to destroy those responsible for his current situation and he has the
        means to do it. To gain new powers or refill your health bar, you'll
        literally absorb other living beings. Find yourself a little low on hit
        points and you can simply grab an innocent bystander, crush his or her
        head, and then consume them for a quick boost. If you find yourself in a
        pinch with attack choppers chasing you through the roads, you can absorb
        a person and morph into their likeness to blend in with the crowd.
        <br /><br />
        As you work your way through the game you'll unlock new and ever more
        exotic powers. There's an air dash and a glide move that help you
        quickly travel from one side of Manhattan to the other. There's a
        massive elbow drop that can destroy a tank in one hit. There's even a
        whiplash arm that can be used to latch onto passing helicopters to
        hijack them, Just Cause style. These moves give Prototype its
        personality. These are what set it apart from most other sandbox games
        and make it worth a look. Sure there are a few guns to fire and some
        tanks you can drive around, but the real draw here is the fact that you
        can turn your arm into a giant blade and then dice monsters with it. Or,
        if you're a bit twisted, the draw is the fact that you can grab a person
        by the neck and simply run across the city with their flailing body in
        tow.
        <br /><br />
        But how long can you do flying elbow drops onto tanks or throw people
        off of rooftops before it gets boring? The world itself here is far from
        the most engaging...
        <br /><br />
        The answer to that will vary by the player, but obviously messing around
        with the powers isn't all there is to do in Prototype. The storyline
        involves 31 missions including everything from simple seek and destroy
        affairs to stealthy infiltrations to escort missions and massive boss
        battles. Most of these missions are standard in design. In fact, if
        you've played many open-world games, you've probably played identical
        copies of these in the past. And since repetition is oftentimes the name
        of the game here, you can be sure you'll be doing uninspired tasks over
        and over again.
        <br /><br />
        Quite often Prototype follows the design philosophy of everything and
        the kitchen sink. Instead of fighting a few enemies, the game tosses
        dozens upon dozens at you. Then it throws in a few tanks and helicopters
        as well as a couple dozen innocent bystanders for good measure. It's a
        design that creates a lot of tension, though I found the action too
        chaotic at times. Even the policing system is dialed to the max and too
        aggressive. You can't do something as simple as run through the city
        while leaping off of buildings without alerting the Strike Teams, at
        which point you're forced into some shape shifting or combat. This can
        make the basic act of exploration more work than it should be. There is
        very little downtime to counteract the high stress of the missions.
        <br /><br />
        Prototype's design leans heavily on the fact that you can refill your
        health by consuming victims at any time. Some attacks can drain half of
        your health bar or more. Others juggle you in the air leaving you open
        to frustrating combos from enemies. And sometimes you'll think you've
        dodged an attack only to get hit a few feet away anyway. But it's OK,
        because you can always go get more health, right? Not really. The action
        heavy sequences involve barely surviving to the next checkpoint or
        running in and out of the action ad nausea trying to stay alive. Skilled
        players won't have too much trouble, but Prototype's chaos could quickly
        become overwhelming for others. I found several points of the game to be
        unnecessarily aggravating to the point where I would have turned
        Prototype off and walked away if I weren't reviewing it.
        <br /><br />
        Alongside the main quest is a set of side missions called events to
        tackle at your discretion. Beat them and you earn some Evolve Points
        (EP) used to upgrade Mercer's powers. Radical smartly hands out EP like
        candy. Complete just a mission or two and you'll quickly find yourself
        spending EP to grab new powers and abilities early and often. It's hard
        to stop playing when you know you'll get a new move by making it through
        just one more mission.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of variety in these events and I
        often found myself wishing they made better use of Mercer's vast array
        of powers. Those included here are dominated by things like checkpoint
        races and killing sprees -- things that have been done so often as side
        missions in games like this that they're hardly worth mentioning. It's
        cookie cutter game design at this point. There is one exception: A
        mission that tasks the player with gliding long distances towards a
        bulls-eye. Why aren't there more imaginative events like this? You can
        throw a person hundreds of yards. Why not include some sort of shot-put
        event? There was a real opportunity to get creative here, but instead
        too many of the side missions directly mirror the mindless killing or
        limited stealth of the main game.
        <br /><br />
        More interesting than the halfhearted side events are the undirected
        diversions. These don't pop up on your city map and aren't missions in a
        traditional sense. These diversions merely exist within the world --
        even while playing through one of the main missions -- for you to
        tackle. The concept of collectibles has been extended to what's called
        the Web of Intrigue. These are people that, by being hunted down and
        consumed, reveal splintered visions of the infection's history. They're
        slick and wonderfully tantalizing -- little in Prototype is more
        exhilarating than being in the midst of a tough mission only to see one
        of these targets stroll by.
        <br /><br />
        There are a couple of other diversions that I found interesting, as
        well, including army bases that must be stealthily infiltrated to score
        weapon and skill upgrades. It's through these that you can even unlock
        the ability to call in airstrikes. I quickly had this skill maxed out --
        infiltrating the bases is pretty darn fun -- only to learn that the
        airstrikes look rather poor. Which brings us to one of the biggest
        problems with Prototype.
        <br /><br />
        Even while confined to a relatively small game world -- Manhattan is not
        recreated to scale -- Prototype manages to have visuals that range from
        bland to downright ugly. The only real savior is the smooth animations
        which do a great job towards making Mercer's powers feel real. Running
        up the side of a building, doing a flip over a railing, and then leaping
        off into a charged drop attack just feels cool.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, there's the rest. The blandness is seen throughout in a
        city recreated with few landmarks and instead filled with generic,
        lifeless buildings. It's seen in the drab color palette. And it's seen
        in a city filled with what appears to be a dozen or so identical clones
        all wandering the streets together. Just climb a building or get in a
        helicopter and look out at the skyline to get an eyeful of Prototype's
        ugliness. The draw distance in Prototype is atrocious. Move quickly
        along the building tops and trees, bushes, cars and other structures pop
        in and out as the game struggles to draw them. Everything else is
        shrouded in an ugly fog. In a game where you spend much of the time
        pouncing from one roof to the next, this ugliness is felt throughout.
        <br /><br />
        It isn't just the streaming world that suffers in the looks department.
        Aside from specific infected buildings, no structural damage can be
        done. You can't even knock over billboards. And when you do take down
        the few buildings you're allowed to damage, the resulting explosion is
        laughably bad. All of the real chaos you can create is limited to
        vehicles and passing pedestrians. Your cool powers don't feel quite so
        cool when you can't even break a window by throwing a tank at it.
        <br /><br />
        These technical issues are so severe that they do in fact impact the
        game's ebb and flow. There are 250 orbs scattered throughout Manhattan
        for you to collect. Unfortunately, you oftentimes can't see them until
        you are literally on top of them. The game engine fails to draw them at
        any meaningful distance. You can be across a street and not know that
        you're within 20 yards of one of these orbs. Without any other ways to
        find them -- there are no maps or sound indicators -- tracking down all
        of the orbs is less fun than it is chore.
        <br /><br />
        It seems Prototype's developers didn't know when to say when. Tons of
        enemies are tossed into the mix, and so the visuals suffer and the
        gameplay occasionally becomes too chaotic and unfocused. Some cutscenes
        feel out of place and pointless while others are well done. Nobody ever
        put the finishing touches on Prototype to tidy it up and make it fully
        presentable.
        <br /><br />
        A case in point is the power set. There are a ton of upgrades to nab in
        Prototype and improving your character is some of the most rewarding
        gameplay offered here. There are so many powers, in fact, that cramming
        them all on a controller proved difficult. The most disappointing moment
        I had while playing Prototype came when I finally earned enough EP to
        unlock the Cannonball move. I don't think I need to point out how cool
        that sounds. And then I looked up how to do a cannonball: Hold the X
        Button and then hit B at the same time while in the air. X and B, two
        buttons that require you to tie your fingers in a pretzel to hit at the
        same time. That's just awful design.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Prototype is a game with many cool features. However, it lacks many of
        the finishing touches that make for a great and memorable game. To say
        the graphics and game engine need work is a massive understatement and
        many of the missions are cookie cutter in design without any real focus
        or attention to detail. Thankfully, Alex Mercer's absorbing and shape
        shifting powers manage to overcome many of the shortcomings of
        Prototype. Though the missions themselves aren't anything special, the
        vast array of powers provides their own variety and flair.
