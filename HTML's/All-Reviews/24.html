      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        It’s been nearly five whole years since the pioneering PlayerUnknown’s
        Battlegrounds first appeared on Steam and popularized the idea of
        pitting 100 players against each other until only the best (or last)
        among them survives. Since then, the original battle royale has been
        locked in a fight for relevance against the many games it inspired, and
        only now has it dropped its entry fee and joined the ranks of its
        free-to-play competition. Now that the novelty has worn off, in some
        ways PUBG has been left wanting compared to newer and more innovative
        battle royales, but its unique focus on massive zones and realistic
        simulation means it hasn’t lost its touch either.
        <br /><br />
        Survival after parachuting into PUBG’s relatively realistic open world
        requires you to be much stealthier and more deliberately tactical than
        you would in, say, the run-and-gun style of Fortnite. For example, you
        might wait for a passing aircraft to drown out your footsteps so you can
        enter a household undetected, or you might use a smokescreen to distract
        a squad of enemy players that are pinning you down from a nearby ridge.
        Firefights are regularly tense and enjoyable, though the wide selection
        of guns tend to be clunkier to fire than other modern shooters too (even
        after you’ve modded them with scopes and extended magazines).
        <br /><br />
        What PUBG has in tactics, it lacks in the “gunfeel” that make games like
        Call of Duty or Apex Legends so enjoyable to play. Weapons are more
        tolerable to handle in third-person mode, but frustratingly inaccurate
        unless you switch to first-person or aim down sights. But since movement
        is clearly designed around third-person play, not to mention you get the
        ability to peek around corners without poking your head out,
        first-person mode feels slow by comparison, and the weapons suffer for
        it. PUBG’s emphasis on realistic bullet physics sets it apart in an
        interesting way, and it makes sense that hitmarkers are absent by
        default because PUBG wants to give you as little information as possible
        to make its fights more intense. But all that also means it’s not nearly
        as slick as, say, Call of Duty: Warzone.
      </p>
      <h2>Third-person play simply feels much better.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Third-person play simply feels much better, and it seems to be because
        your player model is physically simulated in much the same way as a
        character from Grand Theft Auto 5 or Red Dead Redemption 2, with a bit
        more fluidity in movement — so that you aren’t constantly tripping over
        yourself, but you still feel fragile. It’s a tough balance to strike,
        but it’s noticeable that you aren’t playing a game that was particularly
        intended as a first-person shooter when you switch over to first-person
        mode. Aiming down sights is also just plain stiff in comparison to any
        proper first-person shooter, especially Call of Duty or Battlefield.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn’t help that trying to play PUBG with a controller feels like a
        trip down clunky memory lane; weapon swapping and reloading is
        unresponsive, the inventory system is draconian to navigate in tense
        situations, and aiming feels drifty and unreliable. Compare that to
        Fortnite and Apex Legends, which feel equally suited for controllers as
        they do with the good old keyboard and mouse, and it’s not flattering.
        PUBG is a keyboard and mouse game at its core, and my experience on PC
        has been markedly more enjoyable than when I played on the PS5 for this
        reason – not to mention issues with graphics and performance that can
        pop-up on console.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Terrain can be used to your advantage if you approach it like a tactical
        playground.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Each of the seven diverse maps, including the Eastern European-inspired
        Erangel and the golden deserts of Miramar, are at least vast enough to
        get lost in, and you’ll never see everything in one go before most of
        the playable area is swallowed by the shrinking survival zone that
        forces everyone together at the end of a match. They all sprawl across a
        wide variety of outposts, villages, and terrain features such as rivers
        and mountains that can be used to your advantage if you approach it like
        a tactical playground. It’s all gorgeous to look at, but it also serves
        to give you choices in how you survive the encroaching storm and evade
        (or ambush) anybody who may be waiting to pick you off.
        <br /><br />
        It can become tedious to move across them if you and your team of up to
        four find yourselves without a vehicle, though – and when you do find
        one they’re not much fun to drive because of their poor controls and
        clunky physics. Sometimes you might find yourself losing control and
        crashing into the wall if your connection gets spotty, while others you
        could accidentally flip your vehicle entirely and then have no way to
        flip it back over. By comparison, Fortnite leans into its physics
        imperfections and gives you bouncy vehicles, grappling hooks, jump pads,
        and other fun toys to get creative with. PUBG instead leans away from
        them for as clean cut a presentation of realism as it can, and since it
        struggles to deliver that realism in practice, driving around ends up
        feeling stiff and downright unenjoyable.
        <br /><br />
        And because these matches last considerably longer than the typical Apex
        Legends or Fortnite round, there can be quite a bit of dead air between
        long segments of running, driving, biking, or occasionally flying
        around. But of course, the hunt for ammunition, body armor, and medical
        supplies to keep you in the fight is constant enough to fill the space
        between moments of tension. Looting is still rewarding and enjoyable
        because the randomness of it means that you can strike big and find a
        powerful gun or a set of tier three armor just waiting around the
        corner, but there’s no way to know until you take the risk and go
        looking for it.
        <br /><br />
        That expansive map size means that there’s always an opportunity cost to
        action or inaction in PUBG. Every decision is meaningful, but usually
        not enough to spell life or death on its own; will you cut across the
        open field to reach a nearby weapons cache and risk a sniper attack, or
        will you sneak between buildings and hope you find decent loot along the
        way? Do you recklessly drive across the map and risk unwanted attention,
        or do you creep around the edges of the storm and wait for the other
        players to pick each other off before making your move? Lots of
        approaches are viable, and your decisions leading to that chicken dinner
        winner screen is always a thrill.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Hacking has become a noticeable issue with members of the PUBG
        community, but I haven't personally run into anybody that ruined my
        experience.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And if you’re curious about whether it runs well, don’t worry, it does…
        at least on PC. Besides the unwieldy physics, I haven’t run into any
        experience-ruining bugs. And while it sounds like hacking has become a
        noticeable issue with members of the PUBG community, I didn’t personally
        run into anybody that ruined my experience on either the PC or the
        PlayStation 5. That said, it’s a lot better if you’re playing on a
        decent PC. I’ve been playing PUBG on a system that can push out frames
        above a consistent 60fps at 3440 by 1440p resolution on max settings,
        and with the additional field of view, PUBG’s wide landscapes and vast
        draw distances jive together exceptionally well.
        <br /><br />
        By comparison, PUBG is a rough experience on a PlayStation 5. It’s a
        struggle to distinguish other players at long ranges, rendering the
        vastness of PUBG’s maps feeling empty. There is a “Performance” mode
        which aims for a smooth 60fps at 1080p, but the lack of 4K fidelity,
        limited draw distance, and imprecise controls make it difficult to play
        PUBG the way it was designed. You’re also locked to playing with other
        PlayStation and Xbox players, which puts PUBG behind its battle royale
        contemporaries in terms of cross-play with PC and other platforms.
        <br /><br />
        PUBG doesn’t have much meat on its bones if you get bored of skirmishing
        for survival in both solo and team modes. There’s very little in the way
        of custom maps, and the only other official Arcade mode is a lackluster
        Team Deathmatch that you can comfortably ignore. That single-mode focus
        is similar to Apex Legends, and it’s good that your primary option stays
        a lot of fun for a long time, but neither game can hold a candle to the
        versatility of Fortnite.
        <br /><br />
        It’s great then that you can always dip into the dedicated Training mode
        and play with PUBG’s entire collection of weapons and toys, even testing
        them against a firing range, a race car track, and a cool “jump school”
        area that lets you parachute in as many times as you’d like. In fact,
        the new player experience does a fine job of getting you up to speed
        quickly with a few mandatory training matches against easy-target bots.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        It’s far from being “too little, too late” for this venerable battle
        royale to go free-to-play. PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds may be a known
        quantity these days, but its slower paced survival of the fittest
        struggle still creates memorable shootouts and intense moments in nearly
        every match. However, console players might find its efforts to render
        its massive 8x8 km maps in proper detail technically disappointing, and
        no matter where you play its vehicles are no joyride. Thankfully, PUBG
        has plenty of life left in it if you can look past the clunky weapons
        and vehicles to see the much more hectic firefights and interesting,
        tactics-focused survival that house them.
