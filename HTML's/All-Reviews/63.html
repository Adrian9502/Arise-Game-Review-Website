      <span class="author"> BY LUKE REILLY </span>
      <p>
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sprawling Western tale of loyalty,
        conviction, and the price of infamy, chronicling the inevitable collapse
        of a motley crew of Wild West holdouts kicking against the slow march of
        civilisation and industrialisation. Set in Rockstar’s most authentic and
        lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do, so many people
        to meet, and so many places to explore it’s giddily overwhelming. Red
        Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just Rockstar’s greatest achievement to date;
        it’s a game so lacking in compromise it’s tough to know where best to
        start discussing it.
        <br /><br />
        So let’s start at the beginning: It’s 1899 and American outlaws are an
        endangered species. Dutch van der Linde and his gang are on the run
        after a botched heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they’ve
        retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious blizzard is
        covering their escape. We slip into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, an
        exceedingly cool and capable outlaw who was found by Dutch as a boy and
        raised on the wrong side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour
        story.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a self-contained and linear introduction but it’s a clever one. The
        slick cinematics make a hell of first impression, embedding you in the
        gang and bringing you right up close to the characters who are doing
        their best to bellow over the howling wind. It also placed me in a
        distraction-free bubble while I learned some of Red Dead Redemption 2’s
        early controls and systems, which heightened the impact of having the
        full map open up to me a few hours later. The conditions on the mountain
        are almost claustrophobic, with visibility at a premium and thick snow
        trapping Arthur’s feet. Being set loose in the true open world after
        toughing it out in this intentionally oppressive environment really
        underscores the incredible feeling of freedom the full map offers.
        <br /><br />
        And what a world it is broader, more beautiful, and more varied than the
        one we explored in 2010’s Red Dead Redemption by a massive margin
        (though parts of that game’s map are also included). There are snowy
        peaks and dank, alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests and open
        plateaus. Quaint homesteads and grand plantations. Narrow streams and
        great lakes. Dusty gulches and dim caves. There’s the muddy livestock
        town of Valentine, with its wooden buildings and rustic charm, and then
        there’s the imposing city of Saint Denis, a grimy and growing metropolis
        full of modern extravagances like electric trams, paved roads, and
        Chinese restaurants. The vast assortment of ecosystems and environments
        seamlessly stitched together here is nothing short of remarkable.
        <br /><br />
        Red Dead Redemption 2 does an exceptional job at slowly rationing out
        reasons to visit every corner of its huge world, too. I was still led to
        areas of the map I hadn’t yet visited even in the closing stages of its
        60-hour main storyline. Because so many cards are kept up its sleeve,
        the joy of discovering new parts of the world is maintained throughout.
        <br /><br />
        The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is
        extraordinaryThe ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many
        hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and
        diversity of the world; it’s how alive all of those places feel. While
        the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less dense than
        the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife
        to discover, people to interact with (and potentially help), and places
        to scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that seem almost
        indifferent to your presence in them; like life goes on whether you
        stick your nose into proceedings or not. I’ve sat and watched
        lumberjacks felling trees at a bustling logging camp and curiously
        tailed a perturbed Englishman wandering around town looking for his mate
        “Gav.” None of this is crucial to the progression of Arthur’s story; it
        just helps build a world around him that made me feel like a visitor
        rather than the centre of the universe. Red Dead Redemption 2 nails this
        in a way that few – if any – games have before.
        <br /><br />
        The slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to something like the
        slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a big part of how it encouraged me
        to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be manually
        looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so.
        Single-action pistols need to be cocked before firing. Guns Arthur isn’t
        currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee needs to be
        brewed before drinking it.
        <br /><br />
        I suspect some folk may regard this sort of stuff as chore-like, but I
        really dig it. There’s something methodical about it that really helps
        ground Arthur in the world, rather than have him feel like he’s gliding
        through it. For instance, I love the deliberate and mechanical process
        of cycling a new cartridge with a lever-action rifle via a second pull
        of the fire button – you can even pause for dramatic effect halfway
        through. Rockstar’s designers didn’t need to factor that in but I think
        they understand that tiny, almost trivial instances of subtle control
        like this subconsciously seat me into the world as Arthur even more.
        <br /><br />
        The unhurried pace of checking vanquished enemies for goodies is an
        interesting design decision but I quite like the risk versus reward loot
        loop, to be honest. Do I dart around and pickpocket a dozen dead guys or
        do I just get the hell out of Dodge? They’re consequences you have to be
        prepared to accept either because your attention is needed elsewhere or
        because lingering around the scene of a crime naturally puts you at
        further risk of being discovered. Bounties don’t always come cheap. Did
        one of those fellas have a gold nugget in his trousers? Perhaps you’ll
        never know.
        <br /><br />
        About my only major logistical gripe is that the weapons I was
        previously carrying are regularly swapped out for others. Oftentimes
        it’s clearly mission-related to ensure you go into a task with a scoped
        rifle or bow when required, which is fine. More irksome are the times I
        end up with mismatching pistols for dual wielding, with the game trading
        out my preference. The admittedly brief bit of time it takes to swap
        back did elicit the occasional grumble from me.
        <br /><br />
        I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing
        on the world like a virtual museumAt any rate, it’s seriously worth
        settling into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because there’s
        just so much to see and hear. You’ll hear unique, one-time conversations
        that occur in camp after certain missions, as well as other bespoke bits
        of dialogue that reference recent events. Strolling through camp, I’ve
        been privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John Marston and
        his partner, Abigail, to the good-natured con man Hosea Matthews
        regaling the young Jack Marston with stories of his latest fishing
        adventure. This is all happening around Arthur whether you pause to
        eavesdrop or not. It makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of
        the world at large, a place with people going about their business and
        interacting with one another completely independently of you. I can’t
        understate the genuine feeling of life this injects into the overall
        experience for me.
        <br /><br />
        Elsewhere in the world there’s still plenty for those who care to stop
        and smell the roses. Newspapers sold on street corners touch on the
        aftermath of Arthur’s exploits, as well as other things going on around
        the world. Much like in GTA V, you can visit theatres and take in some
        old timey entertainment. Dogs can be patted. I spent a good deal of time
        off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual
        museum. There’s simply too much to list.
        <br /><br />
        The main story missions themselves are a cocktail of high-stakes heists,
        deadly shootouts, desperate rescues, and thrilling chases, mixed with a
        lengthy list of other activities. Many of those function as organic ways
        to teach us about new side hustles and activities that can be
        undertaken, from selling stolen horses to playing poker or fishing.
        <br /><br />
        It all feels great to play, similar in a lot of ways to its immediate
        predecessor but injected with a pile of new animations and multiple
        layers of interactivity. It asks a lot of the finite amount of buttons
        on a controller, but once I became accustomed to which commands require
        a tap and which require a press-and-hold I had few hassles. Shootouts
        are supremely cinematic thanks to plenty of gun smoke and the same style
        of on-the-fly, ever-changing death animations that have characterised
        Rockstar games since GTA IV. You can even shoot off people’s hats and
        pick them up later for yourself.
        <br /><br />
        I think there’s a common presumption that Red Dead Redemption is just
        GTA on a horse, but that’s a bit reductive. Certainly the GTA DNA is
        here, but with far more primitive firearms at your fingertips gun
        battles are more intimate and anarchic. I love the close range clashes,
        hunkered down behind bits of cover exchanging lead with enemies often
        just yards away, or slugging it out in bareknuckle scraps. It’s exciting
        and fun. Combat from horseback is equally well-handled and it’s always a
        grisly highlight to watch unfortunate saps go limp and tumble from the
        saddle in a seemingly endless number of ways. I think Arthur feels a
        fraction heavier than any of the GTA V trio, but I would not say that I
        found his movement cumbersome. I really like how connected Arthur feels
        to the world. I’m not a particular fan of that old-school, skating
        third-person feel – like the player character has no inertia – and
        that’s certainly not present here.
        <br /><br />
        Dead Eye returns, naturally, as it’s been part of the series since Red
        Dead Revolver. It’s had some upgrades this time, the most useful of
        which highlights critical hit areas on a target (very useful for clean
        kills while hunting). It’s still a very effective way to make you feel
        like an unstoppable gunslinger and the gruesome ballet of slow-motion
        death-dealing remains disturbingly satisfying.
        <br /><br />
        I didn’t engage much with the available camp upgrade options – not the
        aesthetic ones, at least. There are some practical upgrades I acquired
        that had gameplay benefits attached, like a boat to go fishing in or a
        map at Arthur’s quarters that unlocks fast travel. I don’t feel like I
        missed much by opting out of purchasing animal skulls and rugs and such.
        This stuff feels a little more like a primer for Red Dead Online, the
        multiplayer component coming at an unspecified later date.
        <br /><br />
        I chose not to do a huge amount of crafting, either, and I was never
        really punished for it. You can craft tonics and satchels, and recipes
        can be discovered throughout the course of the story. However, I mostly
        made it through on purchased items, restocking in camp, and religiously
        ransacking dead bodies for liquor, health tonics, and cigarettes. (I
        created a lot of dead bodies.)
        <br /><br />
        Two new elements I did take quite seriously were horse bonding and the
        honour system. The former is an inspired method of making you treat your
        horse with realistic respect instead of riding the poor thing off cliffs
        or parking it on train tracks for giggles. All horses are unique, and
        only the ones that trust Arthur can be relied upon to stay calm and not
        kick him off in the face of a predator or in a gun battle, and that
        trust is built by riding, brushing, and feeding it. I liked having to
        click in the thumbstick to reassure my horse when he was scared – it
        makes him feel real and establishes a physical-to-digital bond between
        you two. Your horse can die, too, and there’s no bringing him or her
        back if that happens. I kept the same horse from early in the game all
        the way to the finale and was truly attached to that big guy. Some of
        the other folk here have been less lucky and have had to endure the gut
        punch of euthanising their equine comrade (always pack some horse
        revivers, people).
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, Arthur’s personal honour is something that’s in the
        background at all times, rising and falling based on his actions in the
        world. In practical terms, being an outlaw who refrains from killing in
        cold blood and who helps regular folk around the world gets you
        discounts in shops and generally means you won’t have to look over your
        shoulder quite as often for bounty hunters and lawmen. Playing through
        as a vicious monster is also possible, although it’s not entirely clear
        to me whether there’d be some dissonance between that approach and
        Arthur’s actual story. I still need to investigate further, but I’m
        really happy with how my playthrough turned out and the
        outlaw-with-a-soft-side Arthur I chose to inhabit.
        <br /><br />
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is an undeniably pretty game across the board. The
        lighting is fantastic, particularly in dark, misty situations where
        shafts of moonlight stab through the trees, and I love the way it
        handles Arthur leaving weakly-lit interiors into the temporarily
        blinding sun outside. The sunsets are especially spectacular and seem to
        vary depending on the weather system. Some are harsh and beaming while
        others are warm and soft. The facial animation is a noticeable step up
        from GTA V, and the level of granular detail is almost absurd, from the
        way blood smears on Arthur’s shoulder after carrying a kill to the way
        individual strands of his majestic mutton chops quiver in the breeze.
        The way wagon wheels become caked in mud. The way rust builds up on a
        poorly-maintained firearm. It’s another long, long list that speaks to a
        high level of attention to detail.
        <br /><br />
        No matter where you look, everything feels meticulously handcrafted.
        Every consumable is labelled and can be picked up and inspected. Every
        catalogue in stores is full of custom text and illustrations pointing to
        products available for sale or old timey advertisements. Hallways are
        decorated with framed pictures I’ve never noticed repeated throughout
        the world. Remember: this is the game where horse testicles shrink when
        the weather is cold. More than once I found myself temporarily
        hypnotised by the musculature and skin creases on my horse’s butt.
        That’s a weird sentence, but you’re going to be spending a lot of time
        looking at a horse’s butt. It might as well impress you.
        <br /><br />
        No matter where you look, everything feels meticulously
        handcraftedHorses are astonishingly well-animated and feel like genuine
        living creatures as they swing their necks, stomp their feet, and
        shudder their bodies on their own accord. That said, it’d be nice if the
        same self-preservation skills horses display when galloping towards a
        ravine kicked in when careening towards an obstacle in front – I
        definitely clattered into a few posts and fellow riders before figuring
        out my steed generally wasn’t going to avoid those on his own.
        <br /><br />
        Equally impressive is the audio, from the sound effects to the voice
        work to the huge library of music. Whether you’re expecting the
        satisfying metallic crunch of a reload, the iconic twang of a Hollywood
        Western ricochet, or the subtle squeak of a hotel floorboard, it’s all
        there. Bullets fired on mountaintops ring with cracking echoes,
        completely different to the sound of bullets fired indoors. There are a
        wide range of unique sounds that have been recorded to appear just once
        or twice across the whole of Red Dead Redemption 2, like the squeak of
        detonator wire being unspooled or the clink of bottles in the back of a
        moonshine wagon. They’re all constant reminders that little seems to
        have been missed.
        <br /><br />
        I also love how the world seems to be prepared for pretty much any
        action you can think ofI also love how the world seems to be prepared
        for pretty much any action you can think of. Turn around and walk
        straight back into a store you’ve just left and the shopkeeper will
        likely make a comment about how you’re back so soon. Leave a theatre
        before a film is finished and the ticket clerk will quip, “Seems you
        didn’t like that.” Shoot a polite howdy towards two people standing
        together and Arthur will use a plural term rather than a singular
        pronoun. It all contributes to a feeling of rare polish that’s even
        rarer in a game of this girth.
        <br /><br />
        And the music? It’s outstanding. Woody Jackson’s original score is top
        notch – an evocative mix of jangling Ennio Morricone-esque guitar and
        more soulful pieces better suited to patiently trotting through the
        world absorbing its mixture of beauty and ugliness. There are also a few
        occasions where non-instrumental tracks are used to excellent effect;
        one artist, in particular, was a big surprise to me and sings an
        impactful track during a key moment late in the story.
        <br /><br />
        The plot thread holding Red Dead Redemption 2’s astonishing array of
        systems and gameplay opportunities together is Rockstar’s most serious
        and earnest story to date, and certainly the best written. It’s not
        essential to have played Red Dead Redemption to appreciate and
        understand what’s going on here, especially since this is a prequel
        story that takes place 12 years earlier, although I found it very
        rewarding being familiar with the larger plot as it connects to the
        eventual fate of the enigmatic Dutch van der Linde. Arthur’s
        relationship with Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston here is
        also particularly fascinating to me as a fan of the 2010 game, and it’s
        very well-handled. Marston is a crucial part of the story but Rockstar
        has been restrained enough to not spotlight him at Arthur’s expense.
        <br /><br />
        We get to watch an incredibly nuanced performance as Dutch’s confidence
        ebbs and his restraint fadesEven better, however, is watching Dutch’s
        gradual descent from being the charismatic, successful, and clever
        leader of a gang of deadly outlaws to someone on track to become the
        cold-blooded and beaten man being hunted down by Marston 12 years later.
        We get to watch an incredibly nuanced performance as Dutch’s confidence
        ebbs and his restraint fades. Excellent, too, is main man Arthur: Not
        only is there an infectious authenticity to his low and smooth tone of
        voice, which seems perfect beneath the swept-back hair and enormous
        mutton chops I let him sprout by only ever shaving his chin, but when
        Arthur himself is a far wearier man by the story’s climax his delivery
        is doubly potent.
        <br /><br />
        The whole cast is great, really. Antagonists like the Pinkertons on the
        gang’s trail are a little thinly painted and something about young Jack
        Marston’s sing-song voice didn’t sit right with me, but Arthur’s
        partners in crime all get swags of screen time; certainly enough to feel
        like convincing, three-dimensional characters that Arthur has a real
        relationship with. What’s more is that despite representing a wide range
        of folk from a variety of disparate cultures – from Irish thug Sean
        Macguire to Native American brawler Charles Smith – they all feel like
        credible human beings and not caricatures.
        <br /><br />
        Combined with strong writing and direction, the result is a game that’s
        sincere instead of satirical, and funny while remaining capable of some
        supremely well-earned emotional moments, especially throughout the truly
        excellent crescendo and epilogue.
        <br /><br />
        And even after completing the epilogue, which is split into two parts
        and longer than many whole games I’ve played in recent memory, I still
        have a stack of strangers that need helping, gangs that need killing,
        cheats to experiment with, and fish that need catching. There are 30
        different types of fish in this game about cowboys. I’ve caught four.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto
        V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous
        depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount
        of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to
        date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and
        play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open
        world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one of this generation’s very
        best single-player action experiences? Here’s your huckleberry.
