      <p>
        Remember when Street Fighter 5 came out and a lot of people were
        disappointed by its distinct lack of meat on its bones? Street Fighter 6
        is the polar opposite. Complete with an excellent 18-character roster of
        both new and returning fighters rendered in a killer new art style, an
        incredibly ambitious online Battle Hub that puts all other online
        fighting game lobby systems to shame, and just about everything you
        could ever ask for when it comes to training tools and systems to help
        you get better at fighting games, it’s a spectacularly feature-rich
        fighting game. Street Fighter 6 takes many swings in many different
        directions, and though not every blow connects, the ones that do are
        absolute knockouts.
        <br /><br />
        The gameplay of every Street Fighter game since Street Fighter 2 can
        generally be defined by a unique mechanic. Street Fighter 3 had parries,
        4 had focus attacks, 5 had the V-System, and now Street Fighter 6 has
        the Drive System. And for my money, it’s the best the series has ever
        seen.
        <br /><br />
        Every character gains access to five powerful abilities that are all
        governed by their Drive Gauge: Overdrive special moves, Drive Rush,
        Drive Parry, Drive Reversals, and Drive Impact. Overdrives are
        essentially the new EX Special Moves and cost two bars, Drive Rush
        allows you to quickly close the distance between you and your opponent
        at the cost of one bar (or cancel out of specific normal attacks at the
        cost of three bars), Drive Reversals allow you to get an opponent off of
        you while you’re blocking their attack at the cost of two bars, and
        Drive Impacts… well we’ll get into those in a bit.
        <br /><br />
        I love this system for a lot of reasons, but chief among them is that it
        opens up so many options, and at the start of every round you have a
        full meter and have access to all of them. There’s no building this
        meter up, or worrying about the amount you’ll have left over for the
        next round. I could start aggressively by using a Drive Rush right out
        of the gate to put on pressure; I could save my meter for Overdrive
        special moves to increase the damage of my combos; or I could fish for a
        crouching medium kick and then Drive Rush cancel it to convert big
        damage off of a single hit. Those are just a few of the options, and
        managing them makes the already extremely cerebral fighting of Street
        Fighter 6 even more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Managing your Drive Meter makes the already cerebral fighting even more
        enjoyable.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The way it’s handled when you run out of Drive Meter is also excellent:
        your character enters a Burnout state where you’re completely unable to
        use any Drive Meter-related techniques; your opponent’s attacks become
        more advantageous on both block and hit; you take chip damage, and Drive
        Impacts are even scarier than before (I swear, we’ll get to Drive
        Impacts in just a bit).
        <br /><br />
        Being in Burnout is a terrible position, but it is far from an
        unwinnable situation. You still move at the same speed, your attacks do
        the same damage, you still have access to all of your super moves, and
        while your opponent’s Drive Impacts are a huge threat, you know that
        they’ll be looking to do them, which can lead to some interesting mind
        games on both sides. Some of the most tense and fun matches I’ve had in
        Street Fighter 6 have been when I managed to pull out a victory even
        while in Burnout.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The variety of high-fidelity, performance-captured, expressive faces is
        shockingly good.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Now let’s talk about Drive Impact, because I have a feeling that for a
        lot of people, whether or not they enjoy Street Fighter 6 is largely
        going to come down to their feelings on this one move. Drive Impact only
        costs one bar of drive meter to use, it has super armor that can absorb
        up to two hits, and if it hits while your opponent is in the middle of
        their own attack they will be knocked into a crumpled state, giving you
        a full combo. And that’s not at all! Even if they block it they get
        blown back and lose half a bar of Drive Meter, and if they get backed
        into the corner you get to follow it up with a combo. That’s not all
        either! Remember how I said that they’re even more scary when you’re in
        Burnout? Well, if you block a Drive Impact and you’re close to the wall
        you get stunned and you’ll eat a full combo in the corner, even though
        you blocked their attack. It’s one of the most powerful universal
        mechanics I’ve ever seen in a fighting game, and if you don’t respect
        it, you will get crushed by it.
        <br /><br />
        And yet, I love Drive Impacts, because they’re tuned so that they’re
        just reactable enough to be defended against if you’re looking out for
        them, but also still fast enough to catch you by surprise if you’re not.
        All you have to do is Drive Impact them right back: you’ll absorb their
        attack, hit with yours, and now the roles have reversed so that you get
        the opportunity for a full combo. Countering Drive Impacts is just so
        incredibly satisfying, especially when it’s the key to you turning the
        tables and winning a tight round.

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Street Fighter 6’s roster of 18 characters is mostly familiar, with 12
        returning characters and six being entirely new, but even the returning
        characters feel fresh thanks to new quirks added to their move sets.
        Ken’s command run, for example, now changes up the properties of several
        of his special moves when he uses them out of it, giving them EX-like
        properties without having to spend Drive Meter on them; Cammy can now
        charge her special moves and give them V-Trigger like qualities; and Dee
        Jay has a ton of new feints that make him an extremely tricky character
        to use and play against.
        <br /><br />
        The new blood, meanwhile, are some of the best additions Street Fighter
        has seen. Kimberly is a clear standout, with a ninja-inspired moveset
        that has her closing the distance with quick teleports, piledriving you
        into the ground with Izuna drop-like air throws, and mixing you up with
        tricky leaps from half a screen away. Jamie, meanwhile, is a drunken
        melee powerhouse who is able to buff himself by taking swigs of his
        flask, and once he takes four drinks pretty much all of his moves become
        extremely dangerous with multi-hitting attacks that left me totally
        clueless on when it was actually my turn to try and fight back until I
        labbed against him in training mode.Pretty much every Street Fighter
        character archetype has representation here. You’ve got your grapplers
        in Zangief and Manon; your rushdown fighters in Ken, Jamie, and Cammy;
        your zoners with Guile, Dhalsim, and JP; and your powerhouse bruisers in
        Marissa and Honda. It’s everything I want out of a roster.
      </p>
      <h2>Gonna Take You For a Ride</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        World Tour is an ambitious single-player mode, and while it is a big
        step up from Street Fighter 5’s attempt at a cinematic story mode (and
        anything else Street Fighter has done before) it’s certainly the weakest
        part of Street Fighter 6. It’s at least a great idea: It’s a
        surprisingly enormous RPG that allows you to take a created character
        into the world of Street Fighter, interacting with the playable roster
        by becoming their disciple and learning their moves, and then building
        them up from scratch by leveling up, equipping various types of
        stat-altering gear, and selecting powerful skills. It also does a good
        job of teaching new players the fundamentals of Street Fighter 6 by
        including lessons as sidequests, with steadily increasing difficulty
        over the course of about 20 hours.
        <br /><br />
        However, RPGs live and die by their stories, and the story of World Tour
        is unbelievably dull. With paper-thin characters, predictable plot
        twists, and a mute protagonist whose main purpose is just to be an
        errand boy for various gangs and factions, there’s nothing to get
        excited about. It feels like it was written with the primary purpose of
        having your character jump around to various countries to meet the
        roster characters, and yet it never really bothers to justify those
        trips. In one chapter, a random gangster all of sudden tells me that I
        need to get her bag back that my buddy stole. And so without any
        objection, the most reasonable solution is for me to make a global trip
        to Rome in order to fashion a counterfeit bag that I can hopefully use
        to fool the gangster into thinking I got her bag back. In another
        chapter I had to go to Jamaica and Brazil because my original mentor,
        Luke, wanted souvenirs from those places and doesn’t know how to shop
        online I guess?
        <br /><br />
        At least the tone is goofy and fun, which is a great fit for Street
        Fighter. You can fight just about anyone on the street, regardless of
        whether they deserve a Rising Uppercut to the face or not; it’s fun to
        use ridiculous-looking moves like the Spinning Bird Kick to cross gaps
        like you’re a human helicopter, and there’s a surprising amount of enemy
        variety, many of which do an admirable job of teaching newer players how
        to deal with specific situations that will come up outside of story
        mode. Some enemies will favor blocking high, making them vulnerable to
        low attacks; others will stay permanently in the air and must be brought
        down by anti-air techniques; and others still will try to hang back and
        pepper you with projectiles, forcing you to fight them like you would a
        zoner-type character. And then you can also fight refrigerators… And
        Roombas. It’s weird, but in a very amusing, Yakuza-esque kind of way.
        <br /><br />
        There’s also a variety of fun minigames that do a great job of
        “gamifying” techniques that you actually would use in a typical fight.
        In one of them you have to chop bottles by holding back for a second and
        then quickly moving the stick in the opposite direction and pressing a
        button, which is how you’d perform charge-type special moves on a
        character like Guile or Blanka; another has you making pizza by quickly
        performing special move inputs as they appear on screen; and another
        still has you using your combos to quickly destroy a big rig in a nod to
        the original car-busting minigame from Street Fighter 2.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <h2>
        The best thing about World Tour is outfitting your character with moves
        from every fighter.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The best thing about World Tour, though, and the thing that really
        serves as the carrot at the end of the stick, is the promise of being
        able to outfit your character with moves from every other fighter. By
        the end of the campaign I could use Dhalsim’s teleport to instantly
        appear behind an opponent, hit them with Zangief’s Spinning Piledriver,
        and then use Ken’s Dragonlash Kick to get right back up in their face.
        Being able to customize my character in ways that would make them
        absolutely broken in the real game is a lot of fun.
        <br /><br />
        The issue is that it takes forever to level up a character’s style to
        the point where you learn new moves from them. You do this simply by
        using them, but even though I only used Luke’s and Ken’s throughout the
        entire mode, I still didn’t max out either of them. Those who love a
        good grind may enjoy having plenty left over to unlock after the 20 or
        so hours it takes to complete World Tour, but I would've liked the drip
        feed of new unlocks to be substantially faster considering the sheer
        amount of rewards there are to unlock by maxing out the ranks of each
        character.
        <br /><br />
        I have many more issues with World Tour, but even despite them, I still
        had a fun time with it in the end. It’s a mode that’s more directly
        aimed toward people without a lot of fighting game experience, and I
        think those people will get a ton more out of it than I did. The
        character customization elements are great, the way it incentivizes
        fundamental lessons of how to play Street Fighter 6 by dressing them up
        as side missions and minigames is extremely well done, and there’s just
        an overwhelming amount of content to discover with two very large open
        worlds to explore (both of which have day and nighttime versions that
        each have their own set of side-missions to discover).
      </p>
      <h2>I Got Next</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Another reason why you might want to go through World Tour mode is that
        you’re able to take your character and all the gear they’ve earned into
        the online Battle Hub, which is an online social space where you queue
        into both ranked and unranked matchmaking, or pull up on a cabinet much
        like you would in a local arcade and await challengers.
        <br /><br />
        Online lobbies are not a new thing in the world of fighting games, and
        truthfully, I’ve never been the biggest fan of them, but Street Fighter
        6’s implementation of the Battle Hub has won me over. For one, it’s
        super cool to look at because Street Fighter 6’s character creator is
        absolutely wild, and gives you the freedom to make beautiful creations
        with finely tuned features or unspeakable monsters with out of this
        world bodily proportions, and it’s fun to just wander around the hub and
        see what people have come up with.
        <br /><br />
        There’s also a lot of things to do beyond just parking at a cabinet
        playing with either friends or random players. There’s a section of the
        hub where you can play a rotating selection of classic Capcom games like
        Final Fight and Street Fighter 2; another section where you can play
        Extreme Battles with party-like rule sets and gimmicks; a store where
        you can purchase more customizable clothes for your avatar with in-game
        currency; and you can even pit your created character against others in
        Avatar Battles.
        <br /><br />
        But the most important thing about Battle Hub is that it’s all optional.
        If you don’t want to deal with it, you don’t have to. You can simply
        queue up for ranked or casual matches via a menu, go into training mode
        while you wait, or create a custom room for multiple friends without
        ever having to go through the Battle Hub – which is exactly how it
        should be.
      </p>
      <h2>The Little Things</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        What really pushes Street Fighter 6 over the edge is how it completely
        nails virtually everything outside of its main modes that you could ask
        for in a fighting game. Based on my experience playing pre-launch and in
        all three betas, including the open beta, its netcode is excellent; it’s
        got the best training mode I’ve ever seen in a fighting game, complete
        with frame data and cancel window data; it’s got extremely helpful
        character guides that make it very easy to learn a new character from
        scratch; combo trials that teach you practical combos for a variety of
        situations; load times are extremely quick and rematches are nearly
        instantaneous; you can search for replays with a ton of different
        filters to help you learn matchups; there’s crossplay across Xbox,
        PlayStation, and PC; you can create and join clubs; and so on. Many
        fighting games also have these features, but very few have all of them,
        and especially not right out of the gate.
        <br /><br />
        Street Fighter 6 also deserves credit for really making an effort to
        welcome newcomers in innovative ways. On top of the World Tour mode,
        there’s also a new Modern control scheme that allows you to play without
        having to worry about character-specific command inputs or combo routes.
        Special moves are mapped to a button and a direction, much like Smash
        Brothers – there’s one button each for light, medium, and heavy attacks,
        you can execute combos by holding down an assist button and mashing one
        of the three attack buttons, and you can use super moves just by
        pressing two buttons at the same time.
        <br /><br />
        The playing field is kept even by the fact that those using Modern
        Controls don’t have access to a character’s full repertoire of normal
        moves, but being able to perform special moves with just the press of a
        button is a tradeoff that makes the Modern Control style appealing even
        for those who aren’t beginners.
        <br /><br />
        And for those who just want to hold forward and mash on one button to
        execute special moves and combos, there’s a new Dynamic control scheme
        that’s only usable offline and essentially lets the AI choose the
        attacks for you. Capcom’s really covered all the bases here.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Street Fighter games are always benchmark moments for the 2D fighting
        game genre, but Street Fighter 6 feels extra special. The Drive System
        is an incredible addition to the fighting mechanics that gives you a
        veritable Swiss Army knife of options and meter-management decisions
        right from the start of every single round, the starting roster is the
        best Street Fighter has ever seen, its online netcode through three
        betas has been impeccable so far, and the number of smaller details that
        it nails right out of the gate is unprecedented. It’s so good that even
        the poor story and extremely slow progression of the single-player World
        Tour amounts to only a jab’s worth of damage on its metaphorical health
        bar. Whether you’re completely new to fighting games or are a seasoned
        vet, Street Fighter 6 is a must play.
