      <p>
        After playing Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PlayStation 5, it
        would’ve been really tough to go back to the PS4 version of 2018’s best
        superhero game. Fortunately, Insomniac has retrofitted Peter Parker’s
        adventure with all the outstanding tech it developed for Miles,
        including improved lighting and frame rates, ray-traced reflections,
        lightning-fast load times, and DualSense haptic feedback. And they
        replaced Peter’s face… which is weird, but at least it showcases the
        major improvements to facial animations. This is a game that was already
        worth replaying on PS4, but now that it’s on PS5 it’s a great time to
        revisit New York and see it at its best.
        <br /><br />
        Back in my original Marvel’s Spider-Man review, I called it Great,
        highlighting its awesome swinging through of New York City, its
        excellent Peter Parker story, and battles with familiar villains. I
        griped a bit about some suit powers being way better than others and the
        repetitive optional missions being a drag but it’s overall one of the
        best superhero games ever made.
        <br /><br />
        Two years later, all of that remains true, even next to the open-world
        side mission improvements I just played in the amazing Miles Morales
        adventure. Insomniac’s original Spidey tale is still a great Peter
        Parker adventure, even with a new face, featuring a great clash between
        the lives Peter leads both behind and out of his mask. And yes, it’s
        certainly jarring at first to see that face appear instead of the PS4
        version, but I pretty quickly grew accustomed to this new look. Now I’ve
        come to like it more than the original. It looks more age-appropriate
        and more in line with the boyish but confident charm of Yuri Lowenthal’s
        memorable performance. His take on Peter still stands tall as one of my
        favorites, buoyed by Laura Bailey’s still-wonderful Mary-Jane, William
        Salyers’ broken Otto Octavius, and more.
        <br /><br />
        Re-experiencing Insomniac’s story has delighted me as much as it did the
        first time around, particularly in the wonderful first moments of Peter
        and Mary-Jane on screen together, Spider-Man’s friendship with Yuri
        Watanabe, and some of the bigger personalities of Peter’s foes. Improved
        facial animations, less plastic-y skin, and realistic hair tech add more
        realism to the chemistry between Peter and MJ, with a satisfied smirk
        betraying Peter’s hope that they’ll get back together, as well as the
        despair Otto experiences when his lab is shut down. It’s a big step up.
        <br /><br />
        Characters benefit from the re-done lighting system, and so does
        everything else it touches. From beautiful moments at dusk as the sun
        fades, to indoor interiors of Fisk Tower using the building’s many
        modern light fixtures to more realistically brighten the space,
        everything just looks more beautiful. And married with ray traced
        reflections in the fidelity mode, New York comes alive in a way that
        just wasn’t possible on the PS4. I mean seriously: it has turned one of
        Spider-Man’s most common tasks, stopping a car chase, into a beautiful
        light show of neon signs reflecting off cars and buildings as I chased
        the thieves and webbed them up all through the city. It’s as shiny and
        bright as strolling through Times Square at 2AM actually is, all without
        the real-life headache you probably have...if you’re strolling through
        Times Square at 2AM.
        <br /><br />
        The DualSense is used pretty much exactly as it is in Miles Morales,
        which is excellent in helping to translate the sensation of playing as
        Spider-Man in more detail than ever before. I may never get the
        sensation of webslinging in real-life, but the DualSense’s haptic
        vibrations, trigger resistance, and a subtle “thwip” from the
        controller’s speaker do an admirable job of recreating what I imagine
        it’d be like. Likewise, if you have a 3D audio headset like the Pulse
        3D, you get a nice extra level of immersion as the sounds of sirens go
        by in the distance and angry New Yorkers tell you to watch where you’re
        going as you run by on street level. But of course, my soundbar still
        does a perfectly good job of capturing the layered sounds of Insomniac’s
        New York as I swing through the streets.
        <br /><br />
        Even if you’ve already beaten or even platinumed it on PS4, I’d
        recommend checking out how much more vibrant Insomniac’s New York City
        is. It’s a different time of year than Miles Morales’ Christmas setting,
        so it offers a different enough visual palette even though I’d just
        played that game. And all the fun of the gameplay is still there:
        Peter’s swinging and acrobatic combat flows just as well as I remember,
        and even more smoothly now when you choose the new 60fps performance
        mode (which sacrifices some of the nicer lighting effects). I still find
        myself leaning heavily toward my few suit mod preferences and the side
        missions aren’t any more diverse – I’ve already run into what feels like
        a few dozen muggings – but that’s remasters for you.
        <br /><br />
        The remaster also has all the benefits of bundling all three DLC
        episodes of The City That Never Sleeps. That’s another 10 or so hours of
        play, and it adds a largely satisfying comic book mini-arc that includes
        fantastic character work with Black Cat and Silver Sable. You take the
        bad with the good in the form of the annoying Screwball missions and a
        less-than-stellar second chapter, but these episodes work much better
        together than they did as separate episodes released a month apart as
        they were originally.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Anyone can wear the mask, and it’s lovely and important that Insomniac
        has carried that philosophy into its games.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        On top of that and the free suits Insomniac put out, the remastered
        edition has been enhanced with quality-of-life improvements, like the
        near-instantaneous load times on PS5, and even additions to Photo Mode
        to mirror the handy new lighting features of Miles’ version. Plus, Miles
        Morales’ huge suite of accessibility features have been added (something
        I’m kicking myself for neglecting to mention in my Miles review). There
        are options to change the contrast of the environment, enemy
        readability, quick-time event requirements, and much more. It’s a nice
        step up from the original’s included options. And if recent Spider-verse
        stories have taught us anything, it’s that anyone can wear the mask, and
        it’s lovely and important that Insomniac has carried that philosophy
        into its games.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        If you’ve never played Marvel’s Spider-Man...what have you been doing
        the last two years!? But your procrastination has paid off, because the
        remaster is a much better way to play thanks to the PS5’s fantastic
        lighting effects and loading times. Even as someone who platinumed the
        original, it’s a treat to revisit this improved New York City. The
        gameplay itself feels largely unchanged, but that still leaves you with
        a spectacular Spider-Man adventure, with all its additional content,
        that’s also one of the best superhero games ever made, and a visual
        treat to kick off the PS5 era.
