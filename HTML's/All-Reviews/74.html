      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        FIFA is dead; long live FIFA. EA’s football simulation behemoth has
        returned for one last hurrah after a nasty public divorce with its
        licensor, calling itself ‘The World’s Game’ ahead of a painful name
        change to EA Sports FC, coming next year. But the tagline transcends its
        bittersweet pomp because, for all intents and purposes, FIFA 23
        fittingly does feel like the same game the world has been playing for
        the past few years, with its reliable end-to-end gameplay and familiar
        frustrations.
        <br /><br />
        Even at the end of an era, FIFA 23 marks another year of careful
        attrition from EA, as several tactical and aesthetic revisions
        supplement its sturdy gameplay blueprint. Yet it’s also an entry that
        feels both propped up and consumed by its Ragnarok status, begrudgingly
        pulling down a ruby-red final curtain as the football game genre
        descends into a maelstrom of chaos.
        <br /><br />
        Theatrical additions to gameplay, like the ferocious Power Shots, ensure
        that the FIFA name goes out with a bang rather than a whimper. Holding
        the bumpers and pressing shoot turns your striker into a raid boss with
        an interruptible attack, the camera pulling focus as they leather the
        ball, sending bootstrap shockwaves booming through the PS5’s controller
        speaker. If you get the angle wrong, FIFA 23’s newly improved acrobatic
        goalkeepers might be able to stop it with their individually simulated
        fingers, which have saved my bacon on a few occasions.
      </p>
      <h2>
        This meta-shaking type of shot teases out the halcyon days early 2010s
        FIFA.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Get it right, though, and if the forward has enough space, it’s likely
        to end up in the back of the net, regardless of how far out you are.
        This meta-shaking type of shot teases out the halcyon days of Francesco
        Totti hit-and-hope long shots seen in early 2010s FIFA, but don’t worry;
        online multiplayer is still plagued with speedy wingers passing it
        across the box on the break. Why try and have fun, eh?
        <br /><br />
        While it can’t escape the series’ perennial problem of being
        over-reliant on pacey players entirely, FIFA 23 does reward careful
        execution across the board. My fingers hurt from pulling the triggers to
        jockey dangerous counter-attacks, and the intensity of a pass has to be
        fine-tuned, which is hard to master but satisfying when you place the
        perfect through ball. Rogue tackles will also leave you wide open, as
        holding down the associated buttons for too long can lead to a
        dangerous, crunching commitment that sometimes pays off – but, more
        often than not, it leads to a nail-biting penalty. This turns tackling
        with the last man back into a risky but inherently thrilling endeavour.
      </p>
      <h2>
        This turns tackling with the last man back into a risky but inherently
        thrilling endeavour.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        These changes make FIFA 23 a much slower game than FIFA 22, but the
        tradeoff is that matches are consistently meaningful. There’s an
        abundance of drama in each half, usually multiple goals per match across
        single-player and online, and very few 0-0 draws. Keeping with the
        theatrics, any goal worth its salt will also result in a victory lap
        slow-motion replay with overlaid statistics, guaranteeing that hard
        drives and social feeds the world over will be clogged with
        viral-friendly goal clips by year’s end. Set Pieces are similarly
        convincing, affording you more control over the curl and power of your
        corners and free kicks. It took some time, but the free kicks grew on me
        eventually, as they’re far more intricate and preferable to the chaotic
        stick-pulling of previous years. Likewise, Penalty shootouts play out
        like an intense rhythm game, one in the hands of the gods.
        <br /><br />
        FIFA 23 also includes a visual upgrade – though it’s far more iterative
        and gradual than last year’s leap to PS5 and Series X – focusing this
        time on scuff-happy grass and bouncy hairdos. It’s primarily seen in
        player animations on the pitch rather than actual faces, which still
        vary wildly in quality between cover stars, regular players, and the
        cultish crowd. Defenders will poke their leg around the back of a player
        they’re jockeying, and keepers react convincingly when they don’t have
        vision, diving to the floor as a defender blocks or stumbling backwards
        to swat a deflected ball.
        <br /><br />
        The exhausting match commentary is back with a vengeance, but after
        hearing “he dispatched it with aplomb” one too many times, I was giddily
        reminded that this year you can turn it all off and attempt to undo the
        years of psychic damage from all the negging about your play style. This
        lets you pump in the typically dazzling soundtrack, which offers Bad
        Bunny bangers and underground earworms from DOSS and Cryalot. There’s
        something about slotting away a Bruno Guimarães assist while listening
        to pounding German Drill that makes grinding out a lousy Career Mode
        season much more palatable.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The microtransaction-ridden Ultimate Team is flush with additions.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Beyond the moment-to-moment gameplay, FIFA 23 predictably focuses its
        changes on the mode that makes EA the most money. The
        microtransaction-ridden Ultimate Team is flush with additions, but
        Career Mode and Volta Football barely get a look-in, which says much
        about EA’s long-standing attitude to these modes, especially in this
        supposedly ornamental final FIFA-branded entry. It’s the same gripe we
        have with Madden NFL 23 and NBA 2K23: despite how much we hate how they
        tilt the playing field in favor of whoever pays the most, enough people
        are playing and spending on it that EA just keeps doubling down on it
        instead of the fair and balanced modes we enjoy more.
        <br /><br />
        Player Career has a new personality system that lets you, in most
        dramatic air quotes, roleplay as your chosen footballer. For me, this
        amounted to receiving 25 ‘Maverick Points’ for purchasing a ‘High-end
        Hybrid Mattress’ for a Serbian striker in the K-League, so you can
        imagine how long I stuck with that.
      </p>
      <h2>You can now choose a real manager (or Ted Lasso).</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        You can now choose a real manager (or Ted Lasso, however real you
        consider him to be) to play as in Manager Career too, but unless you
        want to cosplay as a mute Jason Sudekis, or dress Eddie Howe in a lovely
        sweater vest, there’s not much to do beyond gawp at the awkward
        cutscenes. The time spent importing AFC Richmond for its brief novelty
        value could have easily been better used on, for example, implementing
        Women’s Club Football into Career Mode, but that’s still not included.
        It’s a shame because the women’s game is such a compelling example of
        the power of EA’s HyperMotion motion-capture technology, offering
        authentic animations that dial up the immersive tension.
        <br /><br />
        This year, Volta Football and Pro Clubs have been folded into one neat
        section, and they coincidentally both suffer from similar problems. As
        we know, hell is other people, and nowhere is that more apparent than in
        Pro Clubs, where drop-in games are brimming with wingers who overwhelm
        the AI with ludicrous calls to pass the ball. It’s fun to develop your
        create-a-pro into a Shrek-adjacent goal monster with a closet full of
        silly hats, but when your progression is tied to your in-game rating,
        you’re incentivised to perform dispossessing skill move runs that even
        Saint-Maximin wouldn’t bother with.
      </p>
      <h2>
        It seems EA listened to my cries for an enhanced Volta Arcade, so I take
        full credit.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, FIFA’s street football vehicle, Volta, suffers a similar
        fate, epitomised by the new ‘Take Flight’ Signature Ability that turns
        you into an aerial maestro. Because the power relies upon crossing and
        teamwork, most just pick Power Strike and haphazardly smack the ball
        after a glory-seeking run. The good news is that it seems EA listened to
        my cries for an enhanced Volta Arcade, so I take full credit for the
        fact that it has now been expanded into a moreish battle royale mode of
        silly minigames and obstacle courses that evoke the best parts of Fall
        Guys. I still think it’s criminal that it’s only available on weekends,
        though.
        <br /><br />
        Quelle surprise, Ultimate Team has received the most attention, and the
        team training mode I’ve long been looking for has arrived in the form of
        FUT Moments. Moments offers bite-size pockets of FIFA gameplay in the
        form of rewarding challenges designed to test your shape and figure out
        how different cards work together. It’s early doors, but there’s
        tantalising scope to chronicle player careers and recreate immortal
        moments of football history with this mode. The current selection
        features highlights from the golden years of Jurgen Klopp and Kylian
        Mbappe, but in next year’s game, it’d be awesome to see what EA’s team
        can do with other footballing legends like Pelé and ‘King’ Kazuyoshi
        Miura.
        <br /><br />
        Elsewhere, there are sweeping changes to the chemistry system. Chemistry
        is no longer affected by a player’s position in the formation relative
        to other players, a change that enables greater diversity across leagues
        and nations. I don’t think it will change anyone’s strategy too much,
        but it’s nice knowing that you can throw in wildcard players and have
        more ways to connect them to top-division players. Trying to find the
        perfect midfielder to hit that coveted ‘33’ chemistry feels very much
        like a Squad Building Challenge now, which feels intentional. Squad
        Building Challenges are still a fine way to lose a few hours doing
        frankly nothing, but EA’s ‘sudoku for football nerds’ is best played on
        the companion app, away from Ultimate Team’s sluggish console menus.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In a dark portent of the football game licensing wars to come, FIFA has
        lost the J1 League license this year, which meant no more King Kazu.
        Instead, this caused a pivot to an exciting Bronze and Silver Australian
        A League team, featuring the feared strike force of Hibs winger Martin
        Boyle and the aptly named David Ball. Much like last year, my underdog
        team caused a few rage quits from opponents with million-coin ensembles,
        exposing Ultimate Team as a gilded farce. I still felt the deep shame of
        a double-digit thrashing when the pros found me out, though. When more
        people started rolling in, I quickly noticed that playing three at the
        back is a quick route to a 3-0 deficit if the opponent’s wingers have
        any modicum of pace (as they usually do). Overall, it's par for the
        course as far as the online multiplayer is concerned, with fidgety
        twitching and emotions on high across the board; it’s the FIFA we know,
        at its very frustrating best.
        <br /><br />
        Regardless, Ultimate Team’s bread and butter of buying and selling silly
        little guys is still impossible to recommend. Even if I still have a bit
        of fun with it every year without paying, it’s the barbarous nature in
        which you can quickly be pulled into debt by going full Gollum with one
        last precious player pack. Beyond consolidating the transfer markets,
        there have been no meaningful changes to EA’s morally questionable
        approach to microtransactions, but I did notice that ratings now trickle
        upwards during the glitzy reveal, which somehow makes it feel even more
        like a one-armed bandit…
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        FIFA 23 is a bombastic swan song for the series (under its current name,
        at least) with a welcome focus on theatrical flair. FUT Moments, action
        replays and viral-friendly gameplay revisions like Power Shots make it a
        more considered, memorable game of simulated football with intentional
        defending and plenty of drama and goals. But EA's Spartan approach to
        the modes that don't make money ensures FIFA 23 is an all-too-familiar
        beast to previous years, and Ultimate Team’s offensive focus on
        microtransactions continues to take much of the fun out of it.
