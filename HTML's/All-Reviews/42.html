      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        Hide and Seek is a horror game. You run from a pursuer, hurriedly choose
        a hiding spot, then just wait – with only breath and heartbeat in your
        ears – for a pair of legs to pass your slim field of view. They stop.
        You stop breathing. They pass. You start breathing. And then they’re
        back, you’re caught, the game is over. It’s a design that horror games
        have always favoured, but where most shock by using the moment of being
        found, Little Nightmares captures something more nuanced: that creeping
        fright of waiting to be caught.
        <br /><br />
        If you were going to be dull about it, you’d describe Little Nightmares
        as a 2D stealth puzzle platformer. Guiding a tiny, raincoated character
        called Six from left to right through the sea-swaying innards of The Maw
        (an ocean facility with a slowly revealed, despicable purpose) is a
        matter of avoiding instant-death hazards and gentle puzzling about how
        to proceed – but it rarely feels as plainly mechanical as that. At
        around five hours long, Little Nightmares feels slightly too brief –-
        the implied sense of scale suggests there was surely more Maw to see
        than the route Six takes –- but that’s perhaps testament to how much fun
        Tarsier has with throwing ideas at us and leaving them aside once
        they’re done.
        <br /><br />
        Little Nightmares’ closest relatives are Playdead’s exemplary Limbo and
        Inside, not just because of its faint glee at the idea of a child in
        mortal peril, but in how cleverly it braids together puzzle design and
        storytelling. Every enemy, every room, every meat grinder you use to
        make a rope of sausages to swing from, contributes to the story of The
        Maw and Six’s seeming breakout. It’s quietly masterful (not least for a
        studio releasing its first original game) and never more so than in the
        giant, twisted figures of those trying to stop you proceeding. It must
        be said that, where Playdead’s blank stories encourage debate about
        metaphor and meaning, Little Nightmares’ wordless style is a little
        harder to swallow when the story seems more straightforward. Getting to
        know why Six is… the way she is (I’ll say no more on that) feels as
        though it would have added to the experience, rather than ruining any
        mystique.
        <br /><br />
        A nightmarish custodian who literally sniffs you out as his hideously
        long arms feel their way towards your hiding place; twin butchers,
        fattened and deformed by god knows what; the ghoulishly beautiful woman
        in kabuki dress that haunts Six’s dreams. Each owns a stretch of the
        rooms you need to pass through and, as you’re forced to watch their grim
        (if oddly mundane) business in hiding, each teach you a little more
        about just how bad a situation Six is in. All that’s left to do is creep
        past, outsmart them using the room around you or, most horrifying of
        all, realise there’s no fight, only flight, and be forced to simply run
        past in the hope they can’t catch you.
      </p>
      <h2>The Maw itself is something like the world’s worst doll’s house.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Developer Tarsier doesn’t shy away from showing them in their full, grim
        glory. You know where your predators are and what they can potentially
        do to you at almost all times – you’re more worried about them knowing
        where you are. I don’t recall a single jump scare in the entirety of
        Little Nightmares’ runtime, but I know I yelped as a butcher wheezed and
        stooped to check under the greasy workbench I was hiding beneath, or as
        something chased me through a room neck-deep with shoes (an admittedly
        uneasy callback to Holocaust imagery). Six is trespassing on their
        property – the sense that they know the lay of the land in a way you
        don’t is overwhelming.
        <br /><br />
        The Maw itself is something like the world’s worst doll’s house, the
        front walls wrenched away and its themed rooms built to absurd
        dimensions – made to reflect a small child’s view of a giant, adult
        world. It’s lit like a haunted house, regularly forcing you to flick
        open Six’s only possession, a tiny cigarette lighter – but it’s more
        terrifying for not being abandoned. This place – with its nurseries full
        of restlessly sleeping children, curious packages transported by hook,
        and some truly disgusting visitors – is grotesquely functional. It
        allures as much as it repulses, adding up to make for one of the best
        gaming locations I’ve seen in years, startlingly new and painstakingly
        tooled to encourage cautious exploration (including some very
        satisfyingly hidden secrets).
        <br /><br />
        Its dioramas are beautifully drawn and wonderfully tactile, allowing you
        to build makeshift staircases out of gargantuan filing cabinet drawers
        or climb up craning, curling furniture to out-of-sight shelves. Smaller
        objects can be picked up and thrown, most often to no benefit other than
        being a nice way to take your mind off things as you enjoy some
        appropriately childish property damage. On a side note, I don’t think
        I’ve ever enjoyed the soft flumpf of jumping on a digital bed like I
        have in Little Nightmares.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a shame, then, that Little Nightmares’ primary problems are so
        boring. Its ‘2.5D’ set-up (Six can creep some way up the Z-axis in every
        environment) makes certain moments of precision platforming simply
        irritating, specifically when you jump slightly at the wrong angle and
        tumble unnecessarily into an abyss. Likewise, a few of its instant-death
        obstacles are the kind of trial-and-error puzzling that should have been
        left behind last decade. Couple that with inconsistent checkpointing and
        long load times (a trade-off presumably made to allow entire chapters of
        the game to be played seamlessly), and death can become more frustrating
        than frightening.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The camera moves like some floating, flitting eye, watching events
        unfold but unable to do a thing about it.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Those are occasional issues, though, more than made up for in the
        constant pleasure of exploration, which is enhanced by some subtle
        tricks. Environments are often built just bigger than the camera’s field
        of view can handle, almost daring you to look into their dark corners
        (occasionally revealing the horrors to come a little earlier than you
        might expect). The camera itself moves with an ever-so-slight delay and
        sways with The Maw’s ocean rocking, giving the impression of not being a
        perfect lens but some floating, flitting eye watching events unfold but
        not being able to do a thing about it.
        <br /><br />
        There’s much more to enjoy, from the lovely way Six cradles her lighter
        while she runs to stop it going out, to “boss battle” sections that
        require you to outthink your potential captors across multiple rooms,
        constantly re-evaluating where they could emerge from – to the point
        where you simply cower in a dark place, just in case their will breaks
        before yours. It’s the quintessentially well-designed game; animation,
        sound, presentation, and puzzles each affecting the other in a constant,
        gorgeous cycle.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Like Hide and Seek, Little Nightmares confidently captures the
        exhilarating fear of waiting to be found by something that’s hunting
        you. But it also replicates the alien horror of being a child that
        doesn’t understand what’s happening to and around them, and of a
        seemingly familiar environment turned into a series of opportunities for
        safety and danger. Smart, grotesque and never-endingly weird, this is a
        very different, extremely welcome kind of horror game that left me
        wanting more than its brief five hours provides.
