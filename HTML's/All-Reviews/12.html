      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a down-on-their-luck orphan has
        their life turned upside-down when they get whisked away to a
        fantastical new world where they suddenly have magical powers,
        reluctantly rising to become the hero its people need to stop an evil
        threat. If that sounds like every fantasy book you’ve ever forgotten you
        read, it’s probably because Forspoken is a remarkably generic RPG – from
        its bland story to its lifeless open world. Thankfully its energetic
        combat and flashy parkour movement system do keep the relatively slim
        campaign decently entertaining throughout, but running through its
        boilerplate checklist of repetitive side tasks doesn’t hold much appeal
        beyond mindless trophy hunting after that.
        <br /><br />
        The newest action-RPG from Square Enix puts you in the brooding shoes of
        Frey Holland, a well-acted but largely unlikable New Yorker who gets
        pulled through a portal to the fantasy realm of Athia after accidentally
        becoming bonded to an equally unlikable talking armband she calls Cuff.
        The four realms of Athia have been afflicted with a corruption that has
        forced its populace into the last remaining city of Cipal, and it falls
        on Frey and her newly imbued powers to help its citizens and face four
        powerful rulers called Tantas – not that she’s very interested in doing
        so.
        <br /><br />
        Forspoken’s world and story are about as bland as they come, equal parts
        predictable and forgettable. That’s not so offensive on its own, but the
        real crime is how poorly the writing establishes any of its characters
        and the relationships between them – it’s like it constantly assumed I
        must already be invested in these people in a way it never actually made
        me. The most egregious example of this is the chemistry between Frey and
        Cuff, which frames most of the campaign as a sort of buddy cop movie but
        spends almost no time showing these two unlikely partners grow closer
        after their introduction.
        <br /><br />
        Actual bonding apparently happens off-screen, and this story – which is
        mostly told through exposition dumps between large stretches of
        open-world exploration – felt fairly rushed across the 15 hours it took
        me to beat the campaign as a result. That means the snippy banter
        between Cuff and Frey come off as obnoxious rather than endearing. Frey
        is surprisingly vocal about her disdain for most of the tasks Forspoken
        asks you to complete, and Cuff constantly belittles her for no good
        reason in a manner that I think is supposed to come off as friendly
        ribbing but instead feels like awkwardly watching a couple argue at a
        dinner party. This dynamic never really changes, even as Frey slowly
        goes through the motions of her predictable hero’s journey, and it is
        always exhausting.
      </p>
      <h2>Combat and parkour can be fun even if they never get too deep.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Forspoken is essentially split into two parts: talking to townsfolk and
        doing mundane side quests like feeding sheep or chasing cats in Cipal,
        and making your way to some specific point of interest on its absurdly
        large map to further the story. I don’t think the Cipal sections would
        have bothered me if conversations and cutscenes didn’t have such a
        stilted, strangely low-budget feel to them. The performances throughout
        can actually be quite good, even when the writing leans heavily into
        telling rather than showing – but none of it is ever very fun to listen
        to thanks to long, awkward pauses between lines and occasional crowd
        noise or background music that’s so loud it drowns out everything being
        said.
        <br /><br />
        Between visits to Cipal, you’re generally given a target on your map and
        free rein to get as distracted as you’d like along the way. That
        involves sprinting across Athia’s rocky terrain using Frey’s magic
        parkour skills, flipping over obstacles and eventually using a grappling
        whip to swing long distances, and then beating the snot out of enemies
        at various points of interest for new equipment and other rewards. This
        is what you’ll be doing for the vast majority of your time with
        Forspoken, and it can be a lot of fun even if those systems never get
        too deep.
        <br /><br />
        Frey gains four styles of elemental magic over the course of the
        campaign, each essentially a different weapon you can quickly swap
        between with its own set of alternate fire modes and unlockable support
        skills – all of which can then be modestly upgraded as you play. Her
        starting magic is basically an earth-based gun that can be fired rapidly
        or charged for an area-of-effect burst, with skills that root enemies to
        the ground, up your defense temporarily, and more. You don’t even have a
        melee attack until you unlock the fire-based sword option about a third
        of the way through the campaign, which was a little annoyingly
        restrictive at first.
        <br /><br />
        But once you do open up more of Frey’s capabilities, Forspoken’s
        particle effect-filled combat becomes quite amusing. Enemy variety isn’t
        exactly impressive (special larger baddies in particular can be really
        cool the first time you fight them, but less so by the third), but
        elemental resistances and unique quirks pushed me to swap weapons and
        strategies frequently mid-fight in a way I really enjoyed. For example,
        I loved that shielded enemies could be dealt with either by getting
        behind them or by charging an AOE shot and then firing it at the ground
        nearby to knock them off their guard. One-on-one fights can devolve into
        locking onto your target and holding down the trigger while you strafe
        out of harm’s way with Forspoken’s extremely generous dodge system, but
        the group encounters often did a good job of keeping me on my toes.
      </p>
      <h2>Very little of Athia is worth stopping to admire.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Similarly, the parkour system is a mix of straightforward and flashy,
        sending you nimbly soaring across the environment by simply holding down
        the Circle button and pointing yourself in a given direction. Just like
        your attacks, this becomes a lot more fun once you unlock some cooler
        skills, like options that boost your speed with well-timed button
        presses. That said, it is also far more mindless than combat, requiring
        very little nuance even as additional techniques become available to you
        and rarely ever testing your mastery of those moves with difficult
        platforming challenges. Even still, it can be quite a satisfying way to
        fancifully flow from task to task without much thought.
        <br /><br />
        That’s a good thing, too, because there is a considerable amount of
        ground to cover in Athia, and very little of it is worth stopping to
        admire. This world is huge, and the campaign doesn’t even send you near
        half of it. The map is littered with optional side objective markers,
        but there isn’t much reason to go too far off the beaten path to
        complete them when the same small handful of tasks are repeated ad
        nauseam no matter where they are placed. They almost all boil down to
        either fighting some random dudes to earn a reward or just being handed
        one outright, and the payoffs don’t feel particularly necessary unless
        you decide to up the difficulty to Hard. Plenty of open-world games
        follow a similar structure, but Forspoken does it with such a barebones
        transparency that Athia comes off less like a world for you to explore
        and more like a repetitive checklist asking to be crossed off.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn’t help that Athia lacks much in the way of interesting visual
        landmarks, with different areas gated off by blatantly artificial
        mountain ranges and filled with piles of samey rocks and ruins to hop
        over. Each of the four regions offer a little twist to their layout, be
        that wide open fields or extra hills, but they’d still all blend
        together if it weren’t for the distinct color filter slapped onto each
        one. After the credits rolled I ran around this map for another dozen or
        so hours, hoping to find some exciting secrets in the hard-to-reach
        corners I hadn’t visited – but with the exception of an isolated trader
        selling a few neat items (literally the only NPC I met outside of
        Cipal), all I saw was the same side tasks on the same bland landscapes,
        over and over and over again. I’m sure there will be diehard
        completionists out there excited for a chance to put on a podcast and
        spend dozens of hours clearing every single map marker and opening every
        single chest (the kind of game I actually wrote about back in 2019), but
        I was given very little motivation to do so here.
        <br /><br />
        The upside of that lack of urgency is that Forspoken’s progression
        systems mercifully don’t devolve into a grind on its Normal difficulty
        either, never forcing you to do anything you don’t want to. There are
        only three types of equipable items: cloaks, necklaces, and the
        charmingly creative nail polish designs. The first two are basically
        identical, increasing your health, defense, and magic while also
        offering special perks like increasing critical hit chance, while nails
        provide more unique boons like upping a specific type of magic. A light
        crafting system lets you upgrade your cloaks and necklaces by using
        resources you collect out in the field, increasing their stats and
        letting you swap in the perks of any gear you’ve found so far. That
        lends a lot of welcome flexibility to how you choose to play (and your
        fashion choices), but it’s also not the most exciting system since the
        majority of improvements are simple numerical boosts that are hard to
        see the effect of in the heat of battle.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Forspoken is the sort of game you’ve probably seen before – from its
        stereotypical fish-out-of-water fantasy story to its giant open-world
        map full of repetitive optional tasks. Its combat is flashy and fun
        enough to entertain across its comparatively short RPG campaign, with
        fights that do a good job of pushing you to shake up your use of
        elemental powers even when the overall variety of enemies isn’t
        particularly impressive. Its parkour system is also satisfying enough,
        despite the scenery you are running through being about as picturesque
        as a bowl of rocks with an Instagram filter slapped on. There’s a kind
        of person that might be enough for, happy to spend hours and hours
        uncovering every inch of Forspoken’s needlessly large map after the main
        story, but that doesn’t mean I was able to find much reason to do so
        once the credits had rolled.
