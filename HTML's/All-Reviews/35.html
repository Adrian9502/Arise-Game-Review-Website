      <span class="author"> BY JOHN SMITH </span>
      <p>
        Thirteen years after his wife went missing in the small town of Bright
        Falls, author Alan Wake is trapped inside a Dark Place that he can’t
        seem to write himself out of. As I sit down to type out this review of
        Alan Wake II, I can somewhat empathize. This is just so incomparable to
        anything else I’ve played in recent memory that it’s tough to work out
        exactly where to start. Alan Wake II is a single-player adventure that
        seamlessly shifts from slow-burn psychological terror to frantic
        survival-horror action, from gorgeously rendered game worlds to striking
        full-motion video sequences, and from morbid investigations to
        show-stopping musical surprises. It’s bloody, it's bonkers, and for the
        most part it's utterly brilliant. Coming in at the tail end of a
        bumper-crop gaming year packed with absolute bangers, Alan Wake II still
        manages to burn as brightly as a freshly fired signal flare.
        <br /><br />
        Spanning two wildly contrasting realities, Alan Wake II’s roughly
        17-hour story manages to be far more coherent than that of the original
        – despite its substantial increase in complexity. We pick things up in
        present day Bright Falls, taking control of FBI Agent Saga Anderson,
        who’s been dispatched to the small lakeside town to investigate the
        latest victim in a series of ritualistic slaughters: a body found beside
        Cauldron Lake with a gaping hole where his heart used to be. Saga is an
        instantly likable addition to the weird world that Alan Wake shares with
        Remedy Entertainment’s other supernatural game, Control. She’s dedicated
        to her casework but not above a bit of playful banter with her partner,
        Special Agent Alex Casey, and these opening couple of hours of mostly
        combat-free procedural investigation give the story a realistic
        grounding before the darkness starts to descend and every placid
        hillscape transforms into a harrowing hellscape.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The opening couple of hours of mostly combat-free procedural
        investigation give the story a realistic grounding.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Part of the reason Alan Wake II’s main serial killer mystery and its
        numerous subplots are so easy to keep track of is due to the caseboard
        found in Saga’s metaphysical ‘mind place’, which can be accessed at any
        moment with the tap of a button. Each new piece of evidence, character
        profile, or foreshadowing manuscript page found in Bright Falls and its
        surroundings must be manually arranged onto a branching tree of red
        string and palm cards pinned to the wall, corralling it all into order
        and keeping you focused on the case. I’m not ashamed to say that I
        couldn’t get through a season of True Detective (at least, one of the
        good ones) without having one eye on my television and the other on a
        Reddit thread open on my phone, so I loved having this in-built method
        of keeping the facts straight.
        <br /><br />
        As Saga’s investigation progresses in the early moments of Alan Wake
        II’s story, each discovery raises more unsettling questions than it
        answers: Why do so many of the locals behave as though they’ve known
        Saga for years? Why is the janitor character from Control performing
        karaoke in a local town hall? And why did that corpse suddenly haul his
        naked arse out of the morgue and into the woods? Although its difficulty
        level can be adjusted to three different settings, Alan Wake II’s mood
        is always set to uneasy mode.
      </p>
      <h2>The Dark Place Beyond the Pines</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The mystery deepens still when Alan Wake washes up onto the shore of
        Cauldron Lake, rambling about the Dark Place and surprised to learn that
        he’s been missing for the past 13 years. Then Alan Wake II really gets
        weird. From here, the perspective shifts back and forth between Saga’s
        search for the truth in Bright Falls and Alan’s desperate attempts to
        escape his doomed Dark Place dimension, with both sides gradually
        bleeding into each other in increasingly unpredictable and
        discombobulating ways – to the point that I could barely discern fact
        from fiction (within fiction) before eventually resolving into a
        supremely well-executed gut-punch of an ending that neatly ties off the
        bulk of the story threads while tantalizingly leaving a handful of loose
        ones to dangle. Remedy, if you make us wait another 13 years to tie
        these up (and start more) that will be much less endearing.
        <br /><br />
        The alluring power of its contrasting settings only further enhances its
        mystery, but while the lakeside shores of Bright Falls present some
        stunning sunset scenes and detail-rich forest surrounds, it’s the grimy,
        neon-soaked New York plaza setting of Alan’s stages that really show off
        the immense skill of Remedy’s team of artists. Resembling the kind of
        nightmare you might have after spending 24 hours eating cheese and
        watching Taxi Driver and Mean Streets on a loop, this rotten slice of
        the Big Apple is a haunting otherworld that I found consistently
        compelling to explore, from the graffiti-covered construction areas to
        the menacing sprawl of subway tunnels that lie beneath its surface.
        <br /><br />
        Alan’s stages also stimulated a different part of my brain by
        introducing some enjoyable environmental puzzles. Using a paranormal
        table lamp, Alan can absorb the energy from one light source and
        redirect it to another in order to both create a new illuminated safe
        haven from the evils that lurk in the shadows – but also to physically
        alter the world around him and open up new paths forward. It’s a
        dazzling trick that recalls the pulling of the light switch cord to
        blink in and out of the Oceanview Hotel from the Oldest House in
        Control, and it grows in complexity over time: determining the right
        sequence to manipulate multiple light sources progressively ups the
        challenge involved in unlocking each new area to examine.
        <br /><br />
        In place of gathering evidence and arranging it on a caseboard like in
        Saga’s stages, in Alan’s reality you must seek out plot elements in the
        form of floating pairs of orbs that must be observed from the right
        perspective to create an eclipse that triggers ghostly, hardboiled
        scenes from Alan’s own Alex Casey crime novel series. These can then be
        rewritten into Alan’s present scenario to distort his reality into
        disturbing new dioramas that bring him closer towards the dark place’s
        exit, and reveal ominous parallels to the Bright Falls slayings that
        Saga seeks to solve. (And here I was thinking Michael Cera was the only
        Alan desperate to escape a corrupted alternate reality this year.)
      </p>

        And here I was thinking Michael Cera was the only Alan desperate to
        escape a corrupted alternate reality this year.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        To make things all the more disconcerting, Alan Wake II’s Creative
        Director, Sam Lake, plays both the character of Alex Casey in Alan’s
        world and FBI Special Agent Alex Casey in Saga’s story, and also appears
        as himself in a peculiar late night talk show that Alan finds himself as
        a recurring guest on. You might not know his name but you probably know
        his famous face, since it was plastered on the mug of the original Max
        Payne. He even does the signature scowl! Alan Wake II’s heavy
        meta-mystery is like a jigsaw puzzle locked inside a Rubik’s Cube that’s
        covered in sudokus, and it’s honestly such a strange and wonderful trip
        that takes more unexpected detours and recursive loops than a
        disgruntled Uber driver.
      </p>
      <h2>The Violence of the Lamps</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Indeed Alan Wake II features more plots than a cemetery, and just as
        high a bodycount. The fundamentals of combat remain largely the same as
        the enjoyable flashlight-fueled fighting of the original, but its
        execution has been enhanced significantly. Enemies are once again
        literal shadows of their former selves, and the most efficient way to
        dispatch them is by using the boosted beam of your flashlight to burn
        away their cloudy darkness shields and blasting disgusting chunks of
        exposed flesh off their bones with your expanding arsenal of firearms.
        This time around glowing weak points will occasionally be revealed on an
        enemies’ body, and if you manage to successfully target them you can
        inflict substantially more damage and save a few precious ammo rounds in
        the process, which felt like a nice reward for taking an extra fraction
        of a second to carefully line up my shots.
        <br /><br />
        This won’t be a big deal to anybody used to games that allow you to run,
        but if you’re coming back to Alan Wake along with me it is fantastic:
        Both Saga and Alan are blessed with an unlimited sprint ability, which
        marks a huge improvement to the perennially out-of-puff Alan from the
        original, who couldn’t run 10 yards without doubling over like an
        asthmatic who just took a wrong turn into a smokers lounge. Our
        protagonists are generally more nimble, too; the dodge button feels
        snappier and allowed me to more reliably duck under swinging pipes or
        thrown pickaxes, and it even works on the ground should you be knocked
        off your feet, allowing you to quickly roll out of harm’s way and avoid
        any potential follow-up attacks.
        <br /><br />
        But challenge is part of the charm of the original, and Remedy has not
        forgotten that. Saga and Alan may be more fleet-footed in Alan Wake II,
        but ammunition and batteries remain scarce. And although it doesn’t
        quite rival Resident Evil 4 in terms of enemy variety, there are enough
        different gloomy goons to be surprised by that I could never really
        anticipate which breed of shadow warrior was waiting to ambush me down
        any given path. From hulking brutes with sledgehammers to darting wolves
        and freakish, multi-limbed mirror monsters that I can’t quite accurately
        describe, Alan Wake II consistently shuffled its deck to keep my head on
        a swivel and my thumb nervously twitching over the quick select weapon
        menu. Some enemies even throw darkness projectiles that home in on you
        and must either be dodged or carefully caught with your flashlight’s
        beam like a fighter jet’s countermeasures. I haven’t seen this much
        shade thrown since the last Eminem diss track.
        <br /><br />
        There are some wonderfully frantic and distinct boss fights too,
        including a dimly lit, close-quarters scrap with a rampaging reanimated
        corpse who was hellbent on caving my chest in with the sharp end of a
        torn-off tree branch, and another later on that had me desperately
        burning away an arena full of darkness blobs while trying to avoid
        having my head separated from my shoulders by an enemy’s rifle shots
        from afar.
        <br /><br />
        Yet oddly enough, I found that the enemy in Alan Wake II that I feared
        the most was the one that more often than not couldn’t even hurt me.
        Alan’s reality is littered with whispering apparitions, but nine times
        out of 10 they dissipate into wisps of smoke if you train your
        flashlight on them. It’s that tenth instance you need to worry about,
        though, because it’s likely to be an actual physical nasty waiting to
        ambush you from plain sight after you’ve been lulled into a false sense
        of security. As a result, I started second-guessing each and every
        human-shaped shadow – including my own – which felt perfectly in sync
        with Alan’s own unraveling mental state.
      </p>
      <h2>Writing Wrongs</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Alan’s mental health isn’t the only thing here that isn’t as strong as
        it could be. Although the different arsenals of the two playable
        characters each boast their own advantages, from the heightened stopping
        power and reusable bolts of Saga’s crossbow to the expanded
        area-of-effect of Alan’s flare gun, their individual skill trees seem
        somewhat lopsided in their implementation. Whereas Alan’s ‘Words of
        Power’ skill tree features 21 different skills that can each be
        potentially upgraded up to three times over, Saga’s upgrades are limited
        to just three buffs for each firearm in her inventory, and each comes at
        such a high cost of the collectable manuscript scraps hidden around
        Bright Falls that by the time I’d reached the end credits I’d only
        invested in a handful of them. To be frank, they didn’t feel all that
        necessary on the normal difficulty setting, but perhaps they’ll be of
        far greater use in the planned Nightmare difficulty that’s set to be
        added to Alan Wake II post-launch.
        <br /><br />
        Furthermore, and in contrast with Alan’s impressive environmental
        remixing, Saga is regularly saddled with a few too many survival-horror
        stereotypes, like fuse boxes to repair and combination locks to solve
        (although to be fair, decoding the latter does require a significant
        amount of brain power at times). I was also a little bit disappointed
        that there were no new Night Springs episodes to watch on the
        televisions in Bright Falls, although having said that, the commercials
        that are substituted in their place (starring a pair of local
        entrepreneurs called the Koskela brothers) were so hilariously offbeat
        that I still tried to track down every in-game idiot box I could find.
        (I’m talking about fictional commercials, that is, not poorly
        implemented product-placement for Verizon Wireless.)
        <br /><br />
        Still, any issues I had with Alan Wake II sank without a trace like an
        out-of-towner in Cauldron Lake, washed away by the torrent of other
        things that it gets right. It undoubtedly takes a lot of inspiration
        from film and television, taking the Twin Peaks-meets-The Twilight Zone
        base of the original and mixing in the best bits of True Detective,
        Seven, Inception, and more into the pot. But it also folds in some nods
        to some modern gaming classics, blindsiding you with truly unnerving,
        Inscryption-like fourth-wall trickery and eerie full-motion video
        moments that recall 2022’s found-footage freak out, Immortality.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In one truly astonishing early game moment that I don’t want to
        completely spoil here, it even briefly becomes an interactive musical;
        as though the team at Remedy took one look at the ‘Jump Up, Super Star!’
        level from Super Mario Odyssey and decided to appropriate it in the most
        bombastically bizarre way possible. For a glorious 20 minutes or so,
        Alan Wake II resembles something less like a survival-horror video game
        and more like a Rocky Horror Picture Show, and it had me grinning like a
        maniac from the ring of the first riff to the final blazing guitar solo.
        Although Alan Wake II has no shortage of out-of-your-seat scares, it’s
        moments like these that prove Remedy has approached the actual design of
        its long-awaited sequel completely without fear.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Alan Wake II delivers one of the boldest and most brain-bending
        survival-horror storylines this side of Silent Hill 2, presents it with
        uniformly immaculate art direction and audio design, and reinvigorates
        the series’ signature light-based shooting as though it’s been locked
        and loaded with a fresh pack of Energizers. Even though its
        skill-upgrade systems seem a little superfluous and there were a few
        repeated cliches in Saga’s story that stuck in my craw, I nonetheless
        found both sides of this twisted tale to be endlessly fascinating,
        frequently fear-inducing, and consistently surprising. Alan Wake II is a
        superb survival-horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem
        like little more than a rough first draft by comparison.
