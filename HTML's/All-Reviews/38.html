      <p>
        Since Black Myth: Wukong released its first trailer three years ago,
        every year on August 20th, the developer Game Science has shown
        something new about the development progress of the game. However,
        what's different this year is that we finally got to play it. Game
        Science held a large-scale Black Myth: Wukong hands-on event in Hangzhou
        China, inviting over one thousand players from all over the country to
        personally play the latest trial version of this anticipated action-RPG.
        <br /><br />
        This 45-minute demo provided three different boss fights and a
        relatively complete chapter experience. It’s worth noting that after the
        event, the dev team made some adjustments to the trial version based on
        the feedback and suggestions received during the closed-door evaluation
        I participated in. As a result, my experience may differ slightly from
        what others experienced in Hangzhou and at Gamescom in Cologne.
        <br /><br />
        Due to time limitations, this trial version did not include the level-up
        system. However, it provided players with a set of skills and equipment
        that will be obtained in the mid-game of the final version. In addition
        to basic light and heavy attacks, the protagonist's attack stances can
        be switched between three different postures including Smash Form,
        Pillar Form, and Thrust Form at any time. Furthermore, spells such as
        Immobilize, Stone Solid, Ring of Fire, and The Pluck of Many are also
        available for use. There are also two transformation abilities: one
        turns you into the previously seen Fireblade Wolf, and the other results
        in a creature with poisonous attacks. Additionally, players will find
        and collect certain potions for in-game use. It's important to note that
        these configurations may vary slightly depending on the different
        stages.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The first boss in our demo is named Centipede Guai, and it appeared in
        the first 13-minute gameplay trailer released in 2020.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The first boss is named Centipede Guai, and it appeared in the first
        13-minute gameplay trailer released in 2020. This time, it awaits
        players in a horrible cave. Its attack methods include rolling and heavy
        punches, as well as the ability to release poisonous gas. This gas
        inflicts a slow-acting poison effect on the protagonist, causing gradual
        health loss, which can only be cured by consuming antidote potions.
        However, this boss is considered relatively easy overall in terms of
        difficulty for this trial version. After becoming familiar with its
        attack patterns, most players should be able to defeat it easily.
        <br /><br />
        The second boss is the Macaque Chief, as seen in the snow mountain of
        the 2021 trailer. This time, players can experience the sequence just as
        it was shown. You can observe how the protagonist's movements and combat
        in the snow-covered terrain dynamically affect the accumulation of snow
        in real-time. This battle also holds a secret: if the Macaque Chief's
        health is reduced to half within a certain time, it triggers his second
        phase. To encounter the monkey with wings, the protagonist needs to
        venture deeper into the scene. In this state, the monkey's aggression,
        attack range, and attack patterns all increase significantly. It gains
        the ability to launch aerial assaults against the player, making for a
        thrilling and intense encounter.
        <br /><br />
        The third boss is the Tiger Vanguard, who appeared in the 2022 trailer.
        This time, the Tiger Vanguard awaits players' challenges in a blood pool
        in a temple. According to the developers, this boss will play a role in
        the storyline as an NPC who imparts the Stone Solid skill to the
        protagonist. Therefore, you will witness him using this skill during the
        battle. One highlight of this scene is how the water reacts and changes
        dynamically with the actions and combat. The Tiger Vanguard boasts the
        highest attack speed and aggression among the three bosses. Not only
        does he possess both physical and spell-based attack abilities, but his
        combo attacks also deal substantial damage, making it easy to fall
        victim to his assault.
        <br /><br />
        The chapter experience provided during the Hangzhou event is called
        Purple Cloud Mountain. The overall scenery is somewhat reminiscent of
        the in-game footage shown in the 2022 trailer. This is a relatively
        complete level experience, featuring various environments such as
        forests, villages, and temples. There are also as many as four or five
        types of enemies waiting for players along the way. Don't underestimate
        these minions, they also possess the ability to deliver a fatal blow to
        the protagonist with a single strike.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This level features a semi-open map with multiple paths for players to
        explore. It includes a short cutscene, an optional quest to obtain a new
        transformation ability , and a final boss encounter with the two-phase
        transformation, Blood Moon General. This boss is of enormous size, and
        the protagonist can only engage in battle by standing at its feet. It
        possesses the ability to unleash area-wide attacks, making dodging these
        attacks a challenge. Additionally, during its second phase
        transformation, the entire scene is shrouded in a blood moon, and its
        attack patterns undergo some changes.
        <br /><br />
        There is also a detour path in the level that players might not easily
        find, where they can encounter a hidden boss, the Poisonous King. This
        creature has the appearance of a scorpion-like monster. After engaging
        in conversation with it, players need to break the wine barrel beside it
        to start the battle. This hidden boss presents the highest level of
        difficulty in this trial version. It possesses extremely fast attacks,
        deals heavy damage, and boasts skills that inflict poison on the
        protagonist. It took me nearly an hour of fighting to defeat it, and
        there were several instances where I succumbed to poison before being
        able to use the cure potion in time.
        <br /><br />
        From my experience in this trial version, Black Myth: Wukong appears to
        be a classic action-RPG game that features both physical and spell
        attacks, along with an equipment and growth system. The protagonist's
        weapon, the Golden Cudgel, changes its attack range based on the attack
        rhythm. Light attacks can accumulate Focus Points displayed in the
        bottom right corner of the screen, while heavy attacks consume these
        points. Combining light and heavy attacks can create combos. During a
        combo, if you press the heavy attack button just before an enemy's
        attack is about to hit the protagonist, you can expend special points to
        execute a combo that deals greater damage to the enemy in an invincible
        status.
        <br /><br />
        You can also jump and dodge. An instant-dodge allows the protagonist to
        create a phantom and evade the attacks while immediately
        counterattacking. It has no recovery time, allowing for consecutive
        evasions of enemy combo attacks but you need to focus on depleting your
        energy bar. According to the developers, the skill tree will include
        abilities that allow the phantom to explode, dealing damage to enemies.
        <br /><br />
        Black Myth encourages players to combine physical and spell attacks. For
        instance, freezing an enemy with the Immobilize before attacking can
        result in dealing more damage to the enemy in a safer way. Additionally,
        the timing of spell usage affects their effectiveness. Using the Ring of
        Fire and then drinking the gourd will restore more health than using it
        outside the fire ring. Using The Pluck of Many allows you to summon a
        group of clones to assist you and temporarily disengage from battle.
        Moreover, after transforming, the protagonist can wield the specific
        weapons associated with the transformation, such as a fiery blade for
        the Fireblade Wolf or a poisonous attribute for the attacks of the Worm
        Man.
        <br /><br />
        And while Black Myth shares some similarities in its mechanics with the
        Dark Souls series, the combat feel here is quite distinct from any other
        similar games. In my opinion, this distinction arises from the fact
        that, in other soulslike games, players typically wielded weapons like
        swords or axes, with the grip at the weapon's end during combat.
        However, in Black Myth: Wukong, the main weapon is a staff, primarily
        held in the middle. The grip on the staff changes according to different
        moves, creating a varied rhythm and action, even changing the length of
        the staff in combat. The impact feedback from the staff striking enemies
        is quite distinctive as well. Coupled with the support from the spell
        system during combat, Black Myth: Wukong stands apart as an ARPG with a
        unique feel, differentiating itself from other ARPG and action games
        that have come before.

        Ultimately, despite Game Science providing a substantial amount of
        gameplay content in this trial version, there are still numerous
        questions waiting to be answered. For example, whether the protagonist
        possesses other weapons, how the level-up system works and what the
        skill tree looks like, and how many transformations and spells are
        available—all of these questions can only be answered once the game is
        officially released.
        <br /><br />
        Speaking of which, Black Myth: Wukong is currently scheduled for release
        in the summer of 2024. According to Game Science, the game is targeting
        a release on both PC and next-generation console platforms on day
        one.Meanwhile, Game Science has also announced its participation in this
        year's Gamescom and will be offering a playable version for global
        players at the event. Additionally, the Gamescom playable version may
        feature something different from the Hangzhou event. For more details
