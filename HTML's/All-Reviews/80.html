      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        NBA 2K23 is like watching your favorite team clank a wide-open dunk to
        lose the game. They’d been playing well the whole time, with on-court
        gameplay that’s better than ever, plus various retro modes that are
        amazing for basketball history nerds like myself, and there is a litany
        of modes meant to hold your interest over for dozens, if not hundreds,
        of hours. So where does it all go wrong? The NBA 2K franchise has put
        such an emphasis on pay-to-win microtransactions that its most popular
        game mode, the online MyCareer, feels horribly discouraging from the
        outset due to the disadvantage you’ll face unless you’re willing to
        throw down extra cash. So even while NBA 2K23 emulates the game of
        basketball so well, both in its present form and illustrious past of the
        NBA – it’s just more difficult than ever to ignore the emphasis on
        sucking cash out of our wallets.
        <br /><br />
        There was a shocking moment of realization for me a few hours into my
        MyCareer experience: the allotment of virtual currency (VC) I’d earned
        during that time was enough to buy my character a new pair of pants. Not
        a particularly special pair of pants, mind you, but a pair of Under
        Armour black sweats that look similar to the ones I wear when I go shoot
        hoops. Not a terribly impressive reward, and I was already feeling poor
        after spending the majority of the 100,000 VC that came with the $100
        Michael Jordan Edition of NBA 2K23 just to get my player’s attributes up
        to a level that felt competitive for some court action in The City, NBA
        2K23’s impressively large hub for all things MyCareer.
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, even my generous head start on VC wasn’t enough to
        compete with the real big spenders out there, and I’ve already run into
        more of them than I expected. Half of the players I encountered in The
        City were already well above my player’s ratings — likely because they
        decided to shell out extra cash for an attribute buff. For example, even
        as a rebound-focused center, I was regularly getting out jumped and
        rebounded by much smaller players. I found the scores to frequently be
        weighted in favor of teams with high player attribute ratings, and
        whether that’s largely in my head or not, it’s definitely making games
        feel unenjoyable and imbalanced.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Microtransactions are making games feel unenjoyable and imbalanced.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And yes, with enough grinding I could theoretically reach the same
        heights as those players who paid their way to glory on release day –
        but I’ve found that to be a purposefully arduous process. Even playing
        through the MyCareer story mode, which features the story of MP, a
        character forced to earn the favor of the fanbase that drafted him, I
        found myself short stocked on VC. My remaining options (including daily
        login rewards and quests in The City) were unappealing, and I dreaded
        the idea of going back into The City for more beatdowns from
        higher-rated players to earn a pittance for every loss.
        <br /><br />
        This is made all the more frustrating by the fact that, underneath all
        of the microtransactions, there is a genuinely good game that would be a
        lot of fun if I had faith that the playing field would be level. The
        City is dense and fun to explore, even with the difficult-to-control
        vehicle options like riding around on a skateboard. Seeing other players
        in an environment that is just dripping with basketball everywhere you
        look is a really amazing experience. Shopping around can be a lot of
        fun, too – it’s just aggravating that the items, such as apparel and
        mobility options like the skateboard or scooter, often require a chunk
        of the same VC that I need for leveling up my player. Even the courts
        are visually distinct, with my favorite being embedded in a volcanic
        mountainside.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The Jordan Challenge is the most fun I had with NBA 2K23 by a landslide.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Fortunately, NBA 2K23 has plenty of other game modes to spend time in,
        including a couple that I’m in love with. First and foremost, the Jordan
        Challenge serves as an interactive timeline through Michael Jordan’s
        historic basketball career, starting with his 1982 NCAA Championship
        with the University of North Carolina and ending with his last
        championship-winning game against the Jazz in 1998. Accompanying each
        moment are a set of three challenges, often designed to replicate
        Jordan’s performance in each of the specific moments. For instance, one
        challenge in the NCAA Championship game is to score 16 points, and
        another is to grab nine rebounds with Jordan himself. Each of these
        moments is a real spectacle, and is accompanied by retro-style graphics
        and filters. Even though I wasn’t around for many of Jordan’s biggest
        moments, I’ve re-lived them through documentaries like ESPN’s “The Last
        Dance” and re-broadcasts, and that’s enough for the intense nostalgia
        that comes with being able to replicate these moments in game to wash
        over me. It’s the most fun I had with NBA 2K23 by a landslide.
        <br /><br />
        In a similar vein, MyNBA (NBA 2K23’s franchise mode) now offers several
        “eras” to play in, including the Magic and Bird era, the Jordan era, the
        Kobe era, and of course, the modern era. As an NBA history buff, being
        able to dive into the NBA’s various golden ages is an absolute blast. My
        love of sports developed during the early 2000s, so being able to rewind
        the clock and run the court with a dominant Kobe Bryant and Shaquille
        O’Neal is something I never knew I needed so badly.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Runing the court with a dominant Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal is
        something I never knew I needed so badly.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Not only do the era modes replicate most of the rosters of their day
        (for instance, squaring off against obscure players like Carlos Boozer,
        who I had all but forgotten about, was really entertaining), you also
        get to scout players who were in subsequent NBA Drafts. And if you’re
        into NBA history, you’ll note that 2003 was the year future stars like
        Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Bosh were drafted,
        so it is what you could call a target-rich environment. On top of all of
        that, the graphics and retro filters meticulously encapsulate the
        presentation of these bygone eras – though thankfully, there are options
        to turn them off if you’d rather play with the standard, gorgeous NBA
        2K23 look and feel.
        <br /><br />
        On that topic, most of the changes to that look and feel were reserved
        for the various era modes. That being said, there is a really strong
        emphasis on capturing the atmosphere of prior golden ages of the NBA.
        For instance, I got a kick out of Kevin Harlan talking about the
        differences in the NBA and NCAA back in 1982, where there was no
        three-point line in college basketball. Outside of the retro-era
        makeover, there isn’t a lot of new – but that’s forgivable, given that
        the NBA 2K series already delivers the best graphics in sports gaming.
      </p>
      <h2>
        NBA 2K23 is as close as the series has ever come to emulating a real
        game of basketball.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Of course, the retro modes are only this much fun to spend time with
        because the on-court gameplay is so good. And I can say that, without a
        doubt, NBA 2K23 is as close as the series has ever come to emulating a
        real game of basketball. This year 2K appears to have invested less time
        in new big features and more time into a large number of smaller
        gameplay tweaks, almost all of which are entirely welcomed.
        <br /><br />
        The most noticeable of them is the improved sense of weight to
        everything on the court, from player movement to the basketball itself.
        Players move and pivot much more realistically than before, and as a
        result, on-court spacing is finally in a place I feel content with. Some
        of the ball movement I witnessed, including gorgeous kick-out passes
        from a driving Lebron to open shooters, was leagues better than anything
        we’ve previously seen in the franchise. There’s a better rhythm to it,
        too, with transition play feeling more organic and off-ball movement
        creating better passing lanes. This all meshes very well with improved
        AI that is much more competent and able to adapt on the court – it no
        longer lets me get away with throwing the ball down to an elite post
        player like Joel Embiid over and over again. The defense is much quicker
        to rotate, and will employ double teams much more effectively than
        before.
        <br /><br />
        One new behavior I noticed, especially in the retro-era modes and Jordan
        Challenge, is that the CPU is much more intent on giving its best
        players the ball – especially if those players are having success. For
        example, I needed two attempts at the 1982 NCAA Championship challenge
        because I could not – and I mean absolutely could not – figure out a way
        to stop Patrick Ewing in the post. With every subsequent possession,
        Ewing’s teammates seemed content to feed him the ball in the post and
        let him make plays. This held true with other superstars, too, like
        Allen Iverson, who led the charge for nearly 40 points against me one
        game.
      </p>
      <h2>There’s still a little wonkiness from the AI.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There’s still a little wonkiness from the AI that prevents it from truly
        mimicking the on-court NBA experience. For instance, the CPU really
        struggles with urgency late in the shot clock, often firing up shots
        from well beyond the three point line without an attempt to drive or
        make a play. Similarly, it doesn’t always react realistically to getting
        outmaneuvered. Instead of losing a step to the ball handler, they’ll
        twist and turn before trying to get back into place. It’s more that it
        looks weird and less that it impacts the outcome of a game, but it’s
        certainly noticeable – especially when everything else feels so
        realistic.
        <br /><br />
        They may not feel groundbreaking, but there are a few gameplay features
        introduced in NBA 2K23, and one of them, the adrenaline boosts, has
        grown on me. Each player has three adrenaline boosts per possession, one
        of which is consumed every time you make a hard cut or dribble.
        Initially, I was concerned that boosts lacked nuance and that everything
        was made too equal between quick players like Steph Curry and slower,
        more powerful guys like Joel Embiid. In practice, the adrenaline boosts
        are designed in a way that puts a stop to players flying around the
        court and abusing skill moves – it forces knowledge of team play and
        punishes anyone intent on trying to play hero ball with one star.
        <br /><br />
        It’s features like adrenaline boosts, the newly added shot ratings for
        signature jumpers, and a new defensive shading mechanic that make online
        play more fun than ever before. It really feels like a strategic battle
        to determine which player can manage their team’s strengths and
        weaknesses better – each possession is like a chess match. It’s a shame
        the connections can be hit or miss in terms of latency, which can result
        in some frustrating errors when shooting or passing, because there’s
        nothing quite like the challenge of another human player on the sticks.
        <br /><br />
        And, just as its recent predecessors have been, NBA 2K23 is stuffed to
        the brim with different ways to enjoy its immersive and impressive
        gameplay. For instance, the WNBA has several modes to match the NBA,
        including a franchise mode with a ton of customizable options. It’s an
        excellent change of pace, especially if you like growing and managing
        teams. So it’s definitely possible to find a reprieve from the
        microtransaction-focused modes like MyCareer and MyTeam and get a lot of
        enjoyment out of simply playing basketball without obnoxious and
        counterproductive progression systems, you need to essentially ignore
        half of the available content in NBA 2K23.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        I am heavily conflicted about NBA 2K23. On one hand, the new retro game
        modes have reached out to my inner sports geek and given me a way to
        replay NBA history in a way that I’ve never done before. Especially
        paired with a handful of really strong gameplay changes, like improved
        spacing and AI, I foresee myself dumping dozens of hours into reliving
        and reconstructing NBA history. Conversely, I now feel completely and
        utterly isolated from the MyCareer experience. I have no interest in
        shelling out additional cash (even beyond the expensive Michael Jordan
        Edition) or grind for insane hours just to be able to compete on the
        online court, and the density of The City and its shopping opportunities
        is lost on me for the same reason. Instead, I’ll take my metaphorical
        basketball and go home, where I can enjoy the parts of NBA 2K23 that I
        can fully experience without the repugnant emphasis of its
        microtransactions.
