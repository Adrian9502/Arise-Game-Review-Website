      <span class="author"> BY BEN VOLLMER </span>
      <p>
        I have fond memories of playing the original Resident Evil 2 in my dorm
        room at the University of Kansas back in 1998 and thinking the CGI
        cutscenes looked incredibly realistic. (Oh, 1998 Daemon, you had so much
        to learn!) Another great gaming recollection of mine is playing the 2002
        remake of the first Resident Evil on GameCube with its beautifully
        updated visuals, completely new areas to explore, and terrifying new
        enemies. Now, in 2019, Capcom has given me a new experience I’ll
        remember for a long time: this ground-up remake of Resident Evil 2 is a
        very fun, very creepy adventure thanks to its completely new and modern
        graphics, controls, and some smart quality-of-life improvements. The two
        playable characters’ stories aren’t as different as I’d hoped, but I
        enjoyed nearly every gory minute of my return to Leon Kennedy and Claire
        Redfield’s shoes.
        <br /><br />
        hadn’t played the original Resident Evil 2 since its release 20 years
        ago and only remembered the broadest of strokes: I knew it largely took
        place in a police station, the Lickers were introduced, and the giant
        spiders in the sewers were a nightmare. If a similar amount of time has
        passed for you, or if you’ve never played it, it might not be apparent
        what an enormous improvement this remake is unless you look at it
        side-by-side with the original. That’s because instead of the usual
        remastering treatment where we see upgraded resolution and textures hung
        over an old game’s skeleton, here Capcom started from scratch and remade
        the whole thing using the RE Engine, which is the tech that powered
        Resident Evil 7.
      </p>
      <h2>These are the best-looking zombies I’ve ever seen in a game.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Now, instead of pixelated characters running from pre-rendered
        background to pre-rendered background, Resident Evil 2 is a fully 3D,
        over-the-shoulder affair with atmospheric lighting effects, impressive
        facial animations, and the best-looking zombies I’ve ever seen in a
        game. They’re juicier than ever (I’d venture a guess the designers were
        heavily inspired by the Tarman from Return of the Living Dead) and I
        love the way they lurch around and react when you blow off very specific
        chunks of their heads and hands courtesy of the satisfyingly detailed
        dismemberment system.Capcom does noticeably reuse the same handful of
        zombie models, though. Especially later on in the story, you’ll likely
        recognize the same undead faces you blew off way back at the police
        station.
        <br /><br />
        Some events have been rearranged or expanded upon and there are some
        surprising twists I didn’t remember, but this is a mostly loyal remake
        of the suitably dark and twisted story of Resident Evil 2. It’s two
        months after the zombie outbreak of the first Resident Evil, which took
        place mostly in a spooky mansion. The horror has now overrun the
        entirety of Raccoon City, which is divided into three large areas that
        serve as the story’s acts. Exploring its dark hallways, solving puzzles,
        and hoping to god there isn’t a zombie around the next corner all
        remains fun today. Charting each area, learning the lay of the land, and
        eventually overcoming the obstacles in your way really never gets old.
        There are statues with hidden compartments everywhere, mutated reptiles
        stalk the sewers, and there’s a vast scientific lab buried underground.
        None of it holds up against much scrutiny, but they’re all fun places to
        explore.
        <br /><br />
        Our heroes Leon and Claire, meanwhile, have strolled into town at a
        really bad time and are almost immediately separated. The pair is
        likable enough but two dimensional in their unwavering heroism. They
        never have a moment of despair or self doubt, and that makes them a bit
        dull, whereas a couple of the side characters are more charismatic and
        interesting. The mysterious Ada Wong in Leon’s campaign keeps you
        questioning her motives and wondering whose side she’s really on, for
        example.
      </p>
      <h2>
        This is real survival horror, where it always seems like you’re just
        barely scraping by.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Crucially, inventory and ammunition management is still a key part of
        Resident Evil 2’s gameplay. This is real survival horror, where it
        always seems like you’re just barely scraping by with enough ammo and
        healing items. You can’t carry everything you find with you, so what you
        should store and what you should carry is a battle constantly being
        waged in your mind.
        <br /><br />
        Those quality-of-life improvements I mentioned include automatically
        updating your maps to let you know if a room has been cleared of items
        or if you missed something, frequent and unlimited save points, and
        freedom from the infamous barrage of loading screens. All of those are
        very much appreciated when exploring Raccoon City.
        <br /><br />
        Tension has been elevated by the excellent sound design. Very little
        music accompanies gameplay, which leaves plenty of room for creaking
        doors, thunder and rain, the moans of the undead somewhere just out of
        sight, and heavy footsteps of something sinister in the next room over.
        Resident Evil 2 gets atmosphere like nobody’s business.
        <br /><br />
        The real chiller in the first two-thirds of the campaign is the Tyrant
        super-zombie. He appears early on to stalk you, and his emotionless face
        and steady, unstoppable gait make him Resident Evil’s worthy counterpart
        to Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers. Hearing his relentless footsteps
        getting louder and louder, knowing there is nothing I can do to stop
        him, filled me with a true sense of dread. Eventually, though, his
        presence becomes more obnoxious than terrifying, when you’re trying to
        solve a puzzle and advance the story and the big lug just won’t take a
        hint and reside elsewhere.
      </p>
      <h2>Leon and Claire take extremely similar paths.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        I beat the story from Leon’s point of view in eight hours, which felt a
        little short, but I was excited to fire up Claire’s campaign and see the
        fateful evening’s events unfold from an entirely new perspective.
        Unfortunately, whomever you play as in the main game mode, Resident Evil
        2 will be largely the same when you finish and switch to the other
        person’s 2nd Game mode. While there are a handful of new locations, many
        quest items are shuffled to new locations so you need to hunt for them
        again, and you’ll see more and deadlier enemies sooner in the campaign,
        most of the same events happen. Leon and Claire take extremely similar
        paths, meet most of the same people, solve most of the same puzzles, and
        fight most of the same bosses the other one did the first time through.
        <br /><br />
        (In an earlier version of this review I mistakenly played through the
        first versions of Leon and Claire’s stories back to back, which are even
        more similar. Having now played Leon’s 2nd Game, I’m still disappointed
        that there’s only marginally more new things to see and do there.)
        <br /><br />
        Their play styles aren’t entirely identical, at least: If you play as
        Leon first you may get used to dispatching enemies with his shotgun and
        flame thrower, and when you return as Claire you’ll have to learn how to
        adapt your playstyle and make do with a submachine gun and grenade
        launcher. Plus, each hero meets a unique, important person who causes
        them to deviate from the shared path for a short time, and there’s a
        different final boss fight at the end. I enjoyed all of it, though the
        repetition of so much content made it significantly less entertaining
        the second time through. Those small differences aren’t quite enough to
        justify a second playthrough of a very similar campaign.
        <br /><br />
        As much as Capcom added to Resident Evil 2, a couple things are
        noticeably missing. Those giant spiders I remembered being terrified of?
        Not here. I was really looking forward to being scared by more realistic
        monster arachnids. (At least this is good news for arachnophobes who’ve
        missed out on Resident Evil 2 up to this point.) Also, when you press
        start at the title screen, no cartoonishly scary voice says “Resident
        Evil!” Big miss.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Capcom did a fantastic job of resurrecting all the best parts of the
        classic Resident Evil 2 and making them look, sound, and play like a
        2019 game. If you’re of the mind that the series had lost its way for a
        while there, this game is very much a return to form. The zombie combat
        is satisfying and exploring the dilapidated ruins of Raccoon City is a
        thrill. The one big letdown is that the two characters’ stories aren’t
        different enough to make the second playthrough as rewarding as the
        first, even after unlocking the 2nd Game mode. But whichever you choose
        to play as, the experience of playing through the new Resident Evil 2
        for the first time establishes a new standard for remaking classic
        games.
