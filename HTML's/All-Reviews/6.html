      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        I feel like I’m the kind of person Starfield was made for. I loved
        Bethesda’s last single-player RPG, Fallout 4 (maybe a bit too much), and
        there’s nothing I like more than a sci-fi universe with spaceships,
        lasers, and political intrigue flying every which way. And yet, a dozen
        hours into Starfield, I was feeling lost in space. Things never went too
        far off course while I was flying my rinkydink little ship around
        chasing down mysterious artifacts and war criminals with a damn fine
        crew of companions at my side, but man did Starfield make me work hard
        to get through that opening stretch. Even when it mostly righted the
        ship and I was loving the story, sidequests, and launching boarding
        parties on enemy ships, there were still too many problems that
        constantly popped up, forcing me to curb my excitement. It’s a bit like
        Starfield’s own elaborate shipbuilder tool: even though you can slap a
        bunch of high-end parts together and it will technically fly, sometimes
        it’s just not the best fit.
        <br /><br />
        I would expect no less: Bethesda has built out a sprawling universe with
        detailed lore in which humanity has left Earth behind and colonized the
        galaxy, but hasn’t made first contact with sentient aliens as of the
        24th century. It’s chock-full of backstory about wars between its three
        major factions, run-ins with mysterious space deathclaws called
        terrormorphs, pirates, and an immense amount more. I wouldn’t call a lot
        of it especially distinctive – it’s a setting that’s reminiscent of The
        Expanse, Firefly, and Starship Troopers, full of references to every
        sci-fi movie from Aliens to Blade Runner, and of course Interstellar.
        There’s even a fair bit of Indiana Jones influence as it sends you on a
        treasure hunt to collect mysterious artifacts. In fact, there’s a
        significant similarity to what Obsidian created for 2019’s The Outer
        Worlds. But it’s so densely packed in, with more stories around every
        corner, that I found it easy to get invested in it – once I learned the
        difference between the United Colonies and the Freestar Collective.
        <br /><br />
        Creating your character is a matter of picking a background story for
        them that comes with a set of skills and traits, as well as up to three
        modifiers. It’s always a bit tough to choose this on your first
        playthrough, since you don’t really know what you’re getting into and
        there’s no respecing allowed, but none of them is dramatic enough to
        really hinder you. Some – like the one where your parents are alive and
        well (if you don’t pick this they just never come up), or the one where
        a crazed fan follows you around – sound like they’ll be fun to
        experiment with later, which adds a sense of replayability.
        <br /><br />
        After that, while everyone starts out in the same mining camp and
        touches the same space magic that sets off a trippy 2001: A Space
        Odyssey-style vision, Starfield is an immense game that will send you
        off in all kinds of different directions once it hands you the keys to
        your first spaceship. It’s to the point where talking to others who
        played alongside me left us all bewildered and asking questions like:
        <br /><br />
        “Wait, what do you mean you don’t know who the Vanguard are?”
        <br /><br />
        “How did you not meet this person?”
        <br /><br />
        “How are you crafting those weapon mods already?”
        <br /><br />
        “Wow, you didn’t unlock [REDACTED] until level 20?”
        <br /><br />
        “What the heck even is a Va’Ruun?”
        <br /><br />
        “You met who in a bar?”
        <br /><br />
        “Where did you find that ship?”
        <br /><br />
        If you’re not sticking strictly to one questline and just take missions
        as they pop up (sometimes you get them simply by walking past NPCs as
        they chat), you can easily fall down all sorts of wormholes into
        extended chains of missions that take you on adventures that rival
        Skyrim’s in scope. Even after about 70 hours there are major questlines
        I haven’t even touched, and others I barely began. I’m eager to go back
        and finish a lot of those up now that I’ve completed the main story.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        In typical Bethesda fashion, that main quest isn’t terribly flexible in
        how you resolve the situations it thrusts you into. Your options here
        are, for the most part, about picking whether you want to be a boy scout
        for whom a good deed is its own reward, a wise-cracking mercenary who
        asks to be rewarded after doing a good deed, or an all-business
        mercenary who demands to be paid up front to do the good deed. There are
        a few choices you can make that affect who lives and who dies, and
        there’s a decision at the end about which philosophy to embrace heading
        into the final battle, but most of it is going to play out the same way
        because, no matter what, your goal is to solve the mystery of the
        artifacts alongside your secret society of explorers known as
        Constellation. I won’t say much about where the plot goes because
        there’s a lot that can easily be spoiled, but I did enjoy the way it
        probes its biggest concepts – even those we’ve seen plenty of times
        before – in distinctive ways, and there’s plenty of well-written
        discussion about what it all means.
        <br /><br />
        It’s in the side quests that you really get to act out your character’s
        morals: I happened across a dispute between a ship full of colonists and
        an obnoxious resort planet and had options that included peacefully
        resolving the conflict (which involves a clever technobabble puzzle) or
        stealthily sabotaging the ship and blowing up the colonists. There’s a
        storyline that felt very Boys from Brazil-inspired, as well as numerous
        related quests about hunting down war criminals and banned technology
        that pose ethical quandaries to reconcile. You can join up with the
        Crimson Fleet pirates and dive into a life of smuggling and general
        space crime, or take up the mantle of a legendary pirate hunter.
        <br /><br />
        There’s no shortage of interesting companion characters to hang out with
        throughout all of this either. I never felt like my Constellation
        teammates were wasting my time when they asked to chat, since they
        always had something to share about their background or a quest they
        wanted me to help them with. There’s definitely a focus on Sarah, the
        virtuous leader of Constellation, and Sam, a former lawman with a young
        daughter in tow who he lives in fear of letting down. However, I was
        richly rewarded for taking the slightly more eccentric scientist Barrett
        along with me on some missions, and I suspect the others hold a few
        surprises up their sleeves as well – likely even the ones you hire out
        of bars when respectable folks like Sam bail on you for picking too many
        pockets or hijacking too many ships. But you can only take one person
        with you at a time, so I have more exploration to do here.

      <h2>Starfield’s problems are glaring.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        It helps that Bethesda has certainly upped its facial animation game for
        Starfield. Granted, it’s nowhere near as precise and lifelike as
        motion-captured performances we’ve seen in The Last of Us and God of
        War, but it’s on par with other big RPGs where you interact with
        hundreds of NPCs for dozens of hours, like Baldur’s Gate 3. Character
        models are generally expressive enough that they can do justice to the
        excellent voice performances.
        <br /><br />
        Starfield’s problems, though, are glaring – some of which in ways that
        are inherently different from Bethesda’s other games. I have to say that
        the early hours are pretty rough going, and there was a while where I
        was wondering if the stars would ever align. So this review is going to
        go through that rough patch, too, as I lay this out. But bear with me –
        just like Starfield itself, it does get better by the end.
        <br /><br />
        The biggest fundamental contradiction within Starfield’s design is that
        while this is a galaxy-spanning adventure with literally hundreds of
        worlds you can land on and explore, it can feel extremely small when
        each of them is separated by little more than a (thankfully) brief
        loading screen. The first few times I set out I really got into it: I’d
        enter my ship, climb to the cockpit, strap myself in, then watch the
        cool animation as my ship blasted into orbit. Then I’d open the nav
        screen, select a star and a planet to set my course, and grav-jump to my
        destination before selecting a landing spot and watching my ship set
        down in a blaze of retro thrusters and dust. But then I realized that,
        in many circumstances, I could bypass most of that procedure by just
        going to the map screen and jumping to another planet without even
        setting foot on my ship. Put another way, while you can walk across an
        Elder Scrolls or Fallout world without ever fast-traveling, in Starfield
        you can’t go anywhere without fast-traveling.
      </p>
      <h2>In Starfield, you can’t go anywhere without fast-traveling.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        A mission might send you to the other side of the vast starmap, but the
        actual travel time between systems is always the same (and the poorly
        explained fuel system, which is actually just your range, isn’t much of
        a limitation). When I discovered that so much of space flight is
        effectively a series of non-interactive cutscenes, it largely shattered
        the illusion of exploring a vast universe. It’s impossible not to
        compare Starfield to the way you freely enter and exit planets’
        atmosphere in No Man’s Sky, so it’s a bit of a letdown every time you
        see a planet and remember it’s just a picture of a planet you’ll never
        be able to reach by flying toward it. It’s something that happens a lot.
        <br /><br />
        The next nuisance that irritated me no matter where in the Settled
        Systems I roamed is the fact that there are no actual maps – mini or
        otherwise – to refer to when you’re on foot. All you get is an extremely
        low-detail display showing you large points of interest – such as the
        many abandoned research and mining posts where raiders and robots wait
        for you to shoot and loot them – and the large swaths of alien wasteland
        and wilderness that separates them. Within a city, there’s nothing to
        guide you around beyond shop signs and text-only directories that tell
        you what stores are located in which district, but not where they
        actually are.
      </p>
      <h2>
        My guess is this was a choice made to mitigate the fast-travel problem.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        My guess is that this was a deliberate choice Bethesda made to mitigate
        the fast-travel problem, where we’re just zipping through the universe
        without stopping to appreciate the detail and thought that went into
        creating dramatically different cities like the gleaming capital of New
        Atlantis, the frontier settlement of Akila, and the dingey cyberpunk
        metropolis of Neon, among others. And these places are fascinating to
        look at. The reality, though, is that this isn’t even how we get around
        the real world today – not since the iPhone rolled out in 2007 – so it’s
        exasperating to be in the year 2330 with no comparable navigation tools.
        I spent way too much time running in circles searching for basic things
        like vendors to sell my loot to while I tried to memorize the layouts of
        multiple settlements, annoyed that if I were playing after launch I
        could’ve just checked IGN’s guides for their locations. The tradeoff in
        immersion just doesn’t seem worth it.
        <br /><br />
        The third ever-present annoyance is, fortunately, one that stands out as
        something that can be fixed without a major overhaul. Like Bethesda’s
        previous RPGs, Starfield is a game that is roughly 30% inventory
        management… and yet it is shockingly bad at that task. To avoid becoming
        overloaded you’ll constantly need to transfer the weapons, space suits,
        materials, and alien goo you’ve collected between your inventory and
        your companion’s, or to and from your ship’s cargo hold, but maddeningly
        you can’t view the contents and capacities of both the giving and
        receiving container at the same time. You’re just blindly dumping things
        out of one until you get a message saying the other is full. All the
        while, much of the screen is wasted on an overly large image of an item.
        It’s a bizarre and aggravating step backward from Fallout 4, and the
        kind of thing I expect modders to remedy within a week of launch.
        <br /><br />
        Those problems never got better during my playthrough – I just learned
        to live with them. The hump that I did get over, though, is that
        Starfield just doesn’t tell you enough about how its huge collection of
        systems work, and it trickles out the cool stuff too slowly. Out of the
        gate you can’t mod your equipment, you can’t use your spacesuit’s boost
        pack (which is super useful and fun, especially in low gravity, and I
        can’t imagine not having it for an entire playthrough), and you can
        barely use stealth or board enemy ships at all. You have to put a skill
        point, of which you only get one per level, into those to unlock them.
        <br /><br />
        And yet from the start you can build outposts that are a lot like
        Fallout 4’s settlements and can extract resources for you, but Starfield
        doesn’t tell you that you probably shouldn’t bother for a long while.
        Early on you don’t need huge quantities of a single resource, so it’s
        largely a waste of time until you’ve climbed to the higher ranks of the
        crafting skill trees.
        <br /><br />
        You probably don’t want to go out of your way to mass produce anything
        early on, because storage space on the first tier of ships is
        obnoxiously small for the amount of loot you gather (and there are an
        incredible amount of minerals and materials that seemed like I’d be
        kicking myself later for not bringing with me). I resorted to silly
        workarounds like simply throwing junk on the floor of my ship like a
        space hoarder, which somehow doesn’t count toward your storage space.
        <br /><br />
        It’s also worth noting that the worlds you explore are generally
        visually different (with varying levels of gravity) but fairly barren
        and lifeless. You’d expect that from planets that’re mostly
        uninhabitable and untouched by intelligent beings, but that doesn’t make
        them a lot more fun to run around; outside of a handful of scattered
        outposts all there is to do is scan rocks or zap them with a mining
        laser, or sometimes scan and maybe shoot alien wildlife. It’s a far cry
        from Bethesda’s previous games, where you generally couldn’t swing a
        dead mudcrab without hitting something interesting.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There’s one part of the main quest that’s pretty repetitive, too. You’re
        sent to investigate a series of ancient structures, and it’s annoying
        that what you do inside each one is completely identical. The rewards
        are different and enticing enough for me to want to chase them all down,
        at least, but after the first few I couldn’t help but wish that
        Bethesda’s designers had taken some inspiration from Breath of the Wild
        when it came to creating different puzzles for each one.
        <br /><br />
        It wasn’t until a dozen or so hours in that I unlocked enough upgrades
        that things started to gel for me. Starfield is absolutely one of those
        games that takes way too long to get to the good part. But the fact that
        it eventually did get its claws into me forced me to jettison all of the
        “More like Starfailed!” jokes I’d been workshopping into space and focus
        more on what this sci-fi epic gets right – or at least, does well
        enough.
        <br /><br />
        Filed under “does well enough” is combat, which is the thing you’ll
        likely solve most problems with unless you’re extremely dedicated to the
        idea of talking or sneaking your way past most encounters with hostile
        pirates, robots, wildlife, and anything else that looks at you funny.
        It’s not bad, and it’s kept me happily plinking away with my tricked-out
        laser rifles and shotguns, but not especially good, either. Without
        anything new and exciting to fill the void left by Fallout’s distinctive
        VATS system, gunplay is left feeling largely unmemorable. Even when you
        unlock some late-game abilities it’s still pretty straightforward.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        It’s never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds
        that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that’s very much
        the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of
        forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space
        travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow
        rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys
        piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally
        ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it
        out of a nosedive. I’m glad that I powered through the early hours,
        because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got
        rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that
        its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I’d finished the main story
        after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there’s
        still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting
        NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across, and the pull to seek it
        out is strong.
