      <p>
        Editor's Note: We've replaced the video version of this review with one
        that uses gameplay footage recorded on the PC build of Cyberpunk 2077,
        instead of the trailers we had to use previously due to CD Projekt Red's
        pre-release restrictions. The content of the review itself is identical,
        but the gameplay now more closely represents the experience we had while
        playing.
        <br /><br />
        Editor's Note 2: Due to the dramatic difference in performance, we've
        given a separate review score to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions
        of Cyberpunk 2077. We do not recommend it on those platforms at this
        time.
        <br /><br />
        In my experience, great open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim
        aren't defined by the strength of their main story, but that of the side
        missions around it. With Cyberpunk 2077, developer CD Projekt Red has
        taken that philosophy and built an entire game out of it. Apart from the
        surprisingly short but still utterly compelling central questline that
        draws you through its diverse near-future cityscape, the vast majority
        of what you can do in Night City is entirely optional but often still
        extremely impactful on your journey. This more freeform structure isn’t
        without its faults, including loads of distracting bugs, but the
        strength of the missions themselves – optional or not – and the choice
        you have within them make Cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting,
        emotional, and just plain fun RPGs I’ve played in recent years.
        <br /><br />
        You’re thrust into the shoes of V, a mercenary in Night City who
        (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) ends up with the psyche of
        long-dead rockstar and anti-corporate terrorist Johnny Silverhand
        trapped in their head. Johnny, played by the instantly recognizable
        Keanu Reeves, is a wonderfully dislikable jackass – even if, to be
        blunt, Reeves’ stiff performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise
        extremely impressive cast. Even still, Johnny’s confrontational
        relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor
        of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they
        find themselves in.
        <br /><br />
        Once I got past Cyberpunk 2077’s slow burn of an intro – it initially
        took me six hours to even reach the moment where the logo is splashed
        across the screen for the first time – I was all in on this story. That
        opening segment is slightly restrictive relative to what comes later,
        but it does an incredible job of creating a sense of investment in V’s
        struggle, and then keeping that going as the main quests slowly dial up
        the heat. Once past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the
        sprawling map that is Night City; certain neighborhoods may have tougher
        enemies than others, but generally speaking no one’s going to shoot you
        on sight unless you go looking for trouble – and from the early hours
        you’ll already have enough side quests to keep you busy for a long time.
        <br /><br />
        The structure here feels very different from many RPGs I’ve played,
        including CD Projekt Red’s own The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If most game
        structures are built like a redwood tree, with a tall central trunk that
        has paths branching off it as you go higher, Cyberpunk 2077 is more like
        a large bush: you don’t have to travel down its main quest very far at
        all to have dozens of tangled branches already within your reach, all
        competing for your attention. Most are just a phone conversation away,
        too: since this is the future, you often don’t even have to go looking
        for quest givers because people will just call to offer you a job. This
        does somewhat rob Cyberpunk 2077 of a familiar feeling of scaling
        growth, since the options available to you increase rapidly and then
        plateau a bit for most of your playtime, but there’s so much to see and
        do – and still so much not directly handed to you that must be sought
        out – that I didn’t mind trading in that style of discovery for one of
        abundant choice.
      </p>
      <h2>

        struggle.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And while the single, unrestricted urban map means you won’t get that
        “wow” feeling of traveling to an exciting new open world location at any
        point, Night City is so dense, diverse, and consistently beautiful that
        there are opportunities to stumble upon unexpected sights all the time
        within it – for example, I played for nearly 40 hours before I
        discovered there’s practically an entire forest hidden under one of the
        busiest interchanges in town. You’ll be sent through slums, fancy
        corporate towers, dusty deserts, lush greeneries, and even some weirder
        places that are better discovered for yourself. The scale and scope of
        Night City is simply stunning, and driving around marveling at
        everything it has to offer – from the massive skyscrapers to the
        immaculately detailed in-world advertisements that plaster them – is
        frequently rewarding on its own.
        <br /><br />
        In fact, while there is a fast-travel system that gradually unlocks as
        you visit new areas, I almost felt bad about using it on anything but
        the longest trips. Driving manually means you’ll never see a load screen
        and lets you soak in the sights along the way. There’s some real variety
        in the feel and design of its cars too, each with a detailed interior
        that matches the depth of the city around them. And while you’re
        constantly being offered special cars for sale, all of which can then be
        called to you with the press of a button, some of the coolest options I
        won’t spoil are unique rides only unlocked through your actions in
        specific missions.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Night City is the kind of place where if you move through it too quickly
        you’ll miss half of what it has to offer. But don’t let the first-person
        perspective and guns-blazing futuristic combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077
        feels like an RPG through and through. It’s frequently a slow-paced game
        full of rich, beautifully presented conversations and an almost
        mind-boggling amount of choices to make – choice in dialogue options,
        how to build your character, how to approach missions, and beyond. I’d
        frequently reload saves to see how certain situations could have played
        out if I’d done something different, and what I found impressed me
        almost every time. Cyberpunk 2077 lets your choices have a massive
        impact on both V’s own story and those of the characters around them.
        <br /><br />
        At one point I made a recommendation to a character at the end of a
        mission, and the next time I saw him I found out he had lost his job as
        a result – that wasn’t a fail state, as there was plenty more to do with
        him after, but knowing that his fate might look very different in
        someone else’s game where they’d picked a different choice made my
        playthrough feel more personal. Similarly, I was shocked to discover one
        of my favorite missions early on wasn’t even offered to another player
        because of a single decision we’d made differently. I was also floored
        when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the
        story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25
        hours later. I’d unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out
        gunfight into a friendly conversation.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Don’t let the FPS combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG through and
        through.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The missions themselves are also largely delightful, ranging from
        hilarious to deeply emotional to thrilling to intensely dark. I don’t
        want to rob you of the experience of finding them yourself, but vague
        highlights for me range from the gorgeous parade CDPR has already shown
        off in trailers, to a series of gumshoe-style detective missions where
        the amount of evidence you actively seek out can have massive
        repercussions on the results (including one that was so grim it felt
        like playing out an episode of Criminal Minds). I don’t think I’ll
        forget a deeply touching scuba diving mission anytime soon, or
        befriending a goofy AI-controlled vending machine named Brendan. The
        fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is able to have deep, affecting moments
        alongside lighthearted goofs and blaring ads for things like “MILFguard”
        (itself an Easter egg pun on The Witcher’s Nilfgaard, though sex and
        nudity are an almost mundane part of Night City) without any of it
        feeling out of place is a testament to the strength of both its stories
        and the world they take place in.
        <br /><br />
        The depth and variation available throughout most of these is genuinely
        hard to wrap my head around. You have to understand that in Cyberpunk
        2077, just because something is a side mission doesn’t mean it’s not
        important to the story. This may come as a shock to anyone who has
        played CDPR’s previous Witcher games, especially The Witcher 3, but when
        I was mainlining the story it only took me around 20 hours to beat. That
        said, that only gave me access to three distinct endings, all of which
        were enjoyable but offered less control over the outcome than I would
        have expected. It was only after reloading a save from before the point
        of no return and spending another 20 hours playing through side
        missions, falling in love with characters, and leaving more of a mark on
        Night City that I went back to finish the story once again only to find
        my options had been massively expanded through my actions. After putting
        roughly 45 hours into Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to beat it seven
        different ways, including three drastically different final missions and
        five wildly different but satisfying endings after them (plus one
        similar one) – and I still have plenty more to do and lots of mysteries
        to hunt down. The more time you put in, the richer the payoff you’ll get
        in the end.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Cyberpunk 2077 isn't a Rubix Cube to be solved optimally, it's a
        Rorschach Test.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        This is the crux of what’s so impressive about Cyberpunk 2077. It’s not
        a Rubix Cube to be solved in an optimal way but with different routes to
        get there: it’s a Rorschach Test. It’s shorter than the epic-length
        quest you might’ve expected, but with an amount of variation that’s
        almost impossible to keep track of, so whatever you think you see in
        that inkblot is what you’re going to get out of it. There are no wrong
        answers here and nothing forcing you to play more or less than you want
        to. It offers you a marvelous amount of control as a player.
        <br /><br />
        That said, this structure does misfire slightly in how it’s organized
        and presented. The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear
        indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which
        optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnny’s story than
        others. It’s primarily broken into “Main Jobs” that are required to
        progress, “Gigs” that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites
        of action and story, and a “Side Jobs” category that basically houses
        everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date
        with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches.
        What’s frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped
        together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else
        I could impact the larger story and see more endings.
        <br /><br />
        Part of that confusion comes from the three percentage trackers in the
        main menu, each relating to different aspects of V’s journey. While they
        are primarily increased through Main Jobs, some Side Jobs (but not all)
        could also occasionally move the needle as well. These ended up being
        fairly misleading to me, since the first time I finished the story they
        were at 90/25/40%, respectively. The issue here is that they are
        presented like numbers that reflect my progress toward individual goals,
        but don't actually function that way in practice. To be clear, I loved
        pretty much every single job I did, but these percentages mixed with
        Cyberpunk 2077’s freeform mission structure created a false and
        frustrating sense that I was failing to make progress even as I
        completed missions, with no indication of how to fix that.
        <br /><br />
        Once I understood the system more clearly that frustration subsided a
        bit, though individual mission chains can still occasionally feel
        somewhat disjointed at times – like you’re playing through different
        movies that will then maybe affect the Avengers-esque culmination of V’s
        journey later on. But when taken as a whole, what Cyberpunk 2077 is
        doing here is pretty remarkable. Apart from a few recurring anchor
        points, different players could end up seeing wildly different versions
        of V’s story, twisting and breaking away from each other in ways that
        still feel entirely natural.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        While that mission structure is undoubtedly the most interesting way
        Cyberpunk 2077 gives you control, there are also some good old-fashion
        RPG decisions to be made in terms of how you choose to kill (or politely
        incapacitate) those standing in your way. There isn’t any sort of
        traditional class system; instead, you invest points into five primary
        attributes, and then into perks within each of those for more
        specialized improvements. For example, if you’re planning to sneak
        through dangerous situations, the Cool attribute can make enemies detect
        you slower (I’m not sure why, but let’s just roll with it) and the
        Stealth perk page within that attribute is then full of additional boons
        to unlock, like increasing your crouched movement speed or unlocking an
        aerial takedown.
        <br /><br />
        What’s great about this system is that these attributes and perks
        generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted
        to lean into, not punishing me for not investing in something else. Not
        having enough points in Body might make it harder to wield certain heavy
        weapons or mean you can’t bust open a few doors, but you can still
        effectively use shotguns even if you don’t invest in its Assault perk to
        make them stronger. In fact, each perk can level up through natural use
        – so if you put all your points in Intelligence to be a hacking master,
        but 10 hours in realize you’re really enjoying stealth, your Stealth
        perk will improve on its own somewhat whether you’ve invested in it or
        not. As with most things in Cyberpunk 2077, this system is wonderfully
        flexible and consistently rewarding, if a touch overwhelming in just how
        many options you have.

      <h2>
        Combat isn't the most complex dance in the world, but I had complete
        control over the choreography.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Combat itself is another aspect where you’ll largely get more out of it
        the more you put in. Like I said, despite how it looks in action, this
        is truly an RPG and not a first-person shooter. While I initially wasn’t
        in love with the gunplay because of its unexpectedly bullet spongy
        enemies and surprisingly quick damage drop-off at distance, it only got
        better the deeper I went. Perks let you improve those problems in
        statistical ways, but what really made the combat shine is when I
        started finding more unique weaponry and clever cybernetic augmentations
        that elevated things above simply pointing and shooting. Some guns can
        charge up and shoot through walls, and I invested in perks that made
        them both charge faster and hit harder. Alternatively, another player
        could lean into Smart weapons that cause bullets to seek out enemies.
        Add equippable Cyberware like the ability to slow time when you dodge
        while aiming, a double jump, or the savage Mantis blades, and things
        really start to get interesting.
        <br /><br />
        I wouldn’t say that combat ever becomes overly deep in the moment,
        especially the fun but fairly mashy melee options, but I (once again)
        had so much flexibility and control that I could constantly keep things
        fresh and entertaining for myself. I loved opening a fight by stealthily
        marking enemies then going to another room to blast at their outlines
        through a wall, switching to a powerful pistol for precise headshots as
        they tracked me down, then swapping again to my Mantis Blades to rush
        down the last few, all the while lobbing different elemental grenades
        and popping healing items behind cover when I needed to. It’s not the
        most complex dance in the world, but it’s one I felt I had complete
        control over choreographing.
        <br /><br />
        I also love Cyberpunk 2077’s solution for handling its unique Iconic
        weapons, which are generally awarded through missions and have distinct
        attributes and twists to set them apart from typical loot – things like
        the Chaos pistol that changes its elemental damage type every time you
        reload, the Overwatch sniper rifle that comes with a custom silencer,
        or… a dildo club called the Sir John Phallustiff. The clever part here
        is that, in addition to getting the item itself, you also get a crafting
        recipe for it (I rarely used the crafting and upgrade options across the
        60+ total hours I've played, but there are whole perks dedicated to them
        for those who want to dig in deep). Through these, you can replace an
        Iconic weapon with a better version of itself as you progress, keeping
        your favorites relevant the whole way through the campaign. Some even
        have custom display spots in V’s apartment, giving completionists a
        visible reward even when not in use – though it is a little odd that the
        vast majority of the Iconic weapons I’ve found so far seem to be either
        pistols or katanas, causing a bit of awkward overlap.

        The soundtrack is fantastic throughout, but the combat music especially
        stands out.

      <p>
        Between the increased number of available weapons and ability upgrades,
        by the midpoint of my playtime I enjoyed going loud when I had to, but
        almost always tried to stealth through certain situations first if I
        could. Cyberpunk 2077’s level design is frequently a playground of
        decisions to make, be that finding which hidden entrance to quietly
        enter or which door to kick down and start firing through for maximum
        effect. There are tons of valuable items to pick up tucked into hidden
        corners, as well as computer consoles that can be accessed to turn off
        security cameras, open doors, or read emails that might offer clues to
        other things in the area. So while the stealth itself isn’t much more
        complex than crouch-walking out of sight and occasionally doing quiet
        takedowns, I loved puzzling out the best route and then using Quickhacks
        to mess with guards along the way.

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Cyberpunk 2077 kicks you into its beautiful and dazzlingly dense
        cityscape with few restrictions. It offers a staggering amount of choice
        in how to build your character, approach quests, and confront enemies,
        and your decisions can have a tangible and natural-feeling impact on
        both the world around you and the stories of the people who inhabit it.
        Those stories can be emotional, funny, dark, exciting, and sometimes all
        of those things at once. The main quest may be shorter than expected
        when taken on its own and it’s not always clear what you need to do to
        make meaningful changes to its finale, but the multitude of side quests
        available almost from the start can have a surprisingly powerful effect
        on the options you have when you get there. It’s a shame that
        frustratingly frequent bugs can occasionally kill an otherwise well-set
        mood, but Cyberpunk 2077’s impressively flexible design makes it a truly
        remarkable RPG.
