      <p>
        Undawn, one of the most anticipated post-apocalypse survival RPG game
        brought to you by Lightspeed Studios and Level Infinite offers a very
        unique post-apocalyptic gaming experience one can encounter in the
        mobile gaming market. The game uses many features from other
        post-apocalyptic games out there and combines them to deliver a
        different experience. In this Undawn Review, we will try and highlight
        the core offerings of the game and rate it fair and square.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Undawn offers elements from various post-apocalyptic titles of the past
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Most games of this genre revolve around the players building a community
        from scratch having more settlers attracted to the community, and then
        protecting the base from incoming zombie attacks while also laying some
        importance on base-level progression. This is how most games are
        developed and follow the plot. Luckily for us, this is not the case with
        Undawn, as it allows players to experience the storyline more rather
        than just making the game a base-defending simulator.
        <br /><br />
        Undawn offers gameplay that is very similar to Fallout and Days Gone,
        titles that are available for console and PC. As the game starts players
        are introduced to the Raven Squad which is a community in the wasteland
        comprising of fellow wastelanders and is trying its best to repair the
        damage done by the zombies marauding their world.
        <br /><br />
        As the players go and explore the storyline they will explore how the
        community works and will be provided an opportunity to build a house for
        themselves. The housing feature will allow players to express their
        creativity and design their own houses from scratch. This adds a sandbox
        element to the game as it gives the players the freedom to build their
        own signature house in the community.
        <br /><br />
        However building houses and having communities is not the only feature
        this game offers, the game follows the concept of post-apocalyptic
        survival just like other gaming titles namely Fallout as it involves
        enemies of all kinds such as zombies as well as humans which should be
        dealt with in the game. Additionally, resource management plays a big
        role in the game as well, where players might have to plunder resources
        from abandoned establishments or just simply loot them off the dead
        enemy’s body.
      </p>
      <h2>An average storyline with side-quests to keep players entertained</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Next up in our Undawn Review, we would like to reflect our opinions on
        the storyline. The game, Undawn offers a very average storyline that
        revolves around surviving and making the communities stronger and better
        equipped to fend off the dangers posed to them by the undead.
        <br /><br />
        Now as subjective as it may sound, the story could’ve been better with
        more focus on the narration and execution. Some missions and other story
        elements seem a bit off the plot and this makes the game deliver a bit
        of a bland gaming experience.
        <br /><br />
        To make up for the main storyline’s shortcomings the developers have
        added multiple side quests in the game which can be explored and
        completed as per the player’s wish. However, these side quests are also
        as bland as some of the missions in the main storyline.
        <br /><br />
        The concept of discovering these sidequests is pretty cool, as most of
        them are scattered along the map of the game, which is big, and players
        are needed to trigger them by interacting with the NPCs offering these
        quests. This draws inspiration from the console and PC game Days Gone
        which also had the same game setting.
        <br /><br />
        Players are required to travel to different communities spread all
        across the world of Undawn and interact with NPCs to trigger these
        quests, this allows the players to discover the whole map of the game
        which they wouldn’t have done if there was no side quest in place.
        Overall it’s safe to say that the storyline fails to deliver the
        diversity of operations which the game reflects in its gameplay.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A bustling social experience but fails to deliver the same for the open
        world
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The game, Undawn does a very good job of providing a very bustling
        social experience inside the guild where players can relax and can
        encounter many other different players hanging out while doing different
        activities such as having dinners and many such social experiences to
        make sure that players get a real-life gameplay experience. This
        enhances the gaming experience of the guild and makes sure that the
        players enjoy their time while in the guild.
        <br /><br />
        The same however can’t be said for the open world of the game, while
        some of the other settlements in the game offer some side quests the
        other section of the map doesn’t offer much and feels a bit underdone.
        There are animals to hunt in the open but it all becomes really
        repetitive very soon.
        <br /><br />
        One thing which the developers did manage to deliver with the open world
        is the availability of different scene styles, there are different
        terrains and scenes available within the map and this adds to the gaming
        experience.
      </p>
      <h2>Enjoy a detailed and complete character customization experience</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The game, Undawn has a very robust character customization feature
        available for the fans to make use of. Due to this, it is really
        possible for players to have a character crafted inch perfectly to their
        needs and desire. The game offers a very detailed set of character
        models available in the game and it allows the players to have a wide
        choice available to customize how their avatar looks.
      </p>
      <h2>Friendly Skies</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The game also makes a wide range of character-specific accessories
        available for the players to make use of. There are different armor,
        clothing, and headgear for the players to choose from. There are
        different tiers to the clothing as well, higher tiers of accessories can
        be unlocked only after a specific landmark is reached in the storyline.
      </p>
      <h2>Decent Soundtrack and music but lacks in the graphics section</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Undawn actually has very good sound effects and provides good music for
        the gameplay in the background. The English voiceovers are also nicely
        done and fit the aura of the characters perfectly.
        <br /><br />
        Music and Sound while being the most ignored section of a game can
        sometimes make or break the deal for the game in the way the players
        perceive it. By the looks of it, the developers seem to have got this
        issue under check as the game does a great job in this section.
        <br /><br />
        While the game manages to deliver in the sound and music section, it
        really does not impress with the graphics. As hyped as the gaming title,
        undawn was before the launch we expected the game to deliver more
        buffed-up graphics in the game. However, that was not the case and the
        game has a bit outdated graphics, and frame drop issues here and there
        for such a big title being released in 2023. The gameplay however does
        cover up a bit of the shortcomings of the graphics as evident in this
        Undawn review.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        The game, Undawn succeeds in delivering a well-developed and
        well-structured survival post-apocalyptic mobile gaming experience.
        There was a void in the genre for a game to provide a holistic
        post-apocalyptic experience, while Undawn has some of its shortcomings
        and points to be worked upon.
        <br /><br />
        It is definitely one of the better games of this genre available in the
        market and is a step in the right direction to provide the perfect game
        for this genre. With that being said, we hope that with this Undawn
        Review, we were able to rate this game perfectly and do it justice.
