      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        Horizon Call of the Mountain knows what its job is: to ride the
        popularity of Horizon Forbidden West and spearhead Sony’s new foray into
        virtual reality gaming, the PlayStation VR 2. It really goes for it by
        placing less of a focus on the expansive story of Forbidden West and
        much more on spectacle, often wowing with the sights it places in front
        of you. On that level it’s a remarkable technical showcase that lets you
        have a good deal of excitement when taking the handbrake off and handing
        you control of its exhilarating combat. It’s therefore a slight shame
        that it often operates at a much more relaxed pace, which does allow you
        to frequently take in the beauty of its world, but prevents itself from
        thrilling consistently from start to finish. When it does all click,
        though, and those heights are hit, a very fun time is there to be had.
        <br /><br />
        Similarly to how a Disneyland ride borrows from whichever film it's
        based on, Call of the Mountain takes the Horizon experience and
        condenses it into something much more bitesize while trying to keep the
        same flavour. This is exemplified best by the Pirates of the
        Caribbean-like opening, in which your peaceful river cruise is rudely
        interrupted by the likes of a soaring Stormbird and towering Tallneck
        dino-bot. It’s a real credit to the work that developer Firesprite has
        done in translating Guerrilla's original art design into something more
        impressive than any TV screen could do justice to – both in the stunning
        vistas this world offers and the trademark machines that populate it.
        <br /><br />
        The first time you see the scale of some of these creatures really is a
        sight to behold, not only from the shift to true first-person
        perspective emphasizing their true size, but with their presence felt
        further thanks to the haptic feedback felt both in each controller and
        the headset itself: as you quite literally feel the ground shake with
        every step as these massive machines pass by. It’s a real showcase for
        the PS VR2 right off the bat, with huge spectacle blending with small
        detail – right down to the delicate ripples your fingers make in the
        water and the rude splashes made by the feet of giant machines.
        <br /><br />
        Blockbuster opening aside, over the course of its roughly six-hour
        campaign Call of the Mountain takes the essence of Horizon’s gameplay
        and boils it down into a much more manageable set of tools that works in
        VR. Rocky landscapes to explore, hostile machines to take down, puzzles
        to solve – it's all here. What’s notable, however, is that this is very
        much a linear experience that stands in sharp contrast to Zero Dawn or
        Forbidden West’s vast open worlds. An inquisitive mind is occasionally
        rewarded with fun side activities, such as stacking rock cairns or
        collectible archery targets to hit, but mostly you’ll be guided down a
        funneled path. This narrow approach naturally works well in VR, even if
        some of the inherent exploration that Horizon normally offers is lost.

      <h2>
        If you suffer from any level of vertigo, this may not be the game for
        you.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        There are two movement options to choose from: a “gesture”-based system
        that moves you around when holding two buttons and imitating a walking
        motion with your arms, and a more traditional analog stick-based system.
        After trying both I opted for the former for most of my playthrough,
        despite both coming with their pros and cons. At first, the gesture
        system didn’t strike me as overly intuitive, but once I got to grips
        with it I preferred it simply because it made me feel far less nauseous
        when playing for long stretches (by which I mean about 30 minutes). I
        did, however, find myself switching to the analog sticks whenever
        entering combat, as the dodge mechanics associated with this moveset (a
        flick of the right stick) made for a much easier time. Everyone’s
        mileage on this will obviously vary based on your VR tolerances, so I’d
        recommend trying out both to see which suits you best.
        <br /><br />
        Now’s the time to say that if you suffer from any level of vertigo, this
        may not be the game for you. I’m not too terrible with real heights, but
        here I did start to feel a little queasy when looking down at some of
        the ludicrous distances I could fall from. There are quite a few
        opportunities for potential plummets as well, thanks to the sheer amount
        of climbing you’re asked to do. Climbing cliffs. Climbing vines.
        Climbing ice walls. Climbing rock faces by lodging dual pickaxes into
        them. Almost so much climbing that you may find yourself wanting to
        climb the walls of your house as well.
        <br /><br />
        Now, I wasn’t naive enough to think that a game called “Call of the
        Mountain” wouldn’t involve some climbing, but I was taken somewhat off
        guard when I found that it really is the majority of what you’ll be
        doing here, especially in the early hours. Climbing isn’t overly
        challenging, but honestly reaching for handhold after handhold gets
        quite dull after you’ve scaled your third or fourth outcrop. It does get
        slightly more interesting once tools such as the grappling Grabcaster
        are introduced, and the immersion of it all as the wind swirls around
        your ears and the excellent music swells as you reach the next peak is
        undeniable. Although some ascents offer slightly more excitement than
        others, I can honestly say I never found climbing to be consistently
        fun. It’s frustrating then, that it dominates much of what you’ll be
        doing in Call of the Mountain, in particular when compared to its much
        less frequent but infinitely more exciting combat sections.
        <br /><br />
        Largely taking place in mini arenas, these gladiatorial battles against
        all manner of unfriendly machine are often the highlight of each
        mission. It’s where the immersion of it all really beds in as you
        briefly forget what era of Earth you’re living in and the rhythm of
        combat takes hold. Armed with the signature Horizon weapon of a bow and
        arrow, you’ll quickly find yourself aiming for enemy weak points using
        the PS VR2’s impressive eyeball tracking tech, and then quick-dodging
        out of the way of flying melee attacks before ducking and weaving your
        head out of the way of projectiles.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a set of combat options that gradually builds over time as well, as
        new ammo types are introduced and your arsenal expanded. As stronger
        foes present themselves, naturally more firepower is needed, and with it
        the levels of excitement to find increase – a thrilling fight against a
        colossal Thunderjaw being a particular highlight. Preparing yourself for
        encounters becomes increasingly more important as you build all sorts of
        elemental arrows in a pleasing crafting system that lets you manually
        attach arrowheads, explosives, and flights, thus further creating a
        tangible connection to the world.
        <br /><br />
        More gratifying than crafting arrows though is, of course, firing them –
        and in this regard Call of the Mountain has really nailed it. Now, my
        real-world archery experience may only stretch as far as giving it a go
        when 11 years old on a school trip, but in my expert opinion this feels
        pretty damn good. There’s a real pleasing “ping” to the way each arrow
        flies off of the bowstring and haptic feedback tickles your palm, and
        then an even greater thrill as it slams into whatever is unfortunate
        enough to be in its way and sets them aflame thanks to explosive Blaze.
        Unlike the climbing, it just never gets old to watch sparks fly and
        machine parts fall off as the fundamentally brilliant Horizon combat
        successfully makes its way into the virtual reality space.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a highly satisfying cadence that works really well in VR thanks to
        its enthralling but never overwhelming speed, but is also forgiving if
        you happen to get blindsided by a roaming Scrapper, for example. If you
        do manage to take some damage you can find a pocket of peace amongst the
        mayhem by going for a snack break and refilling your health bar by
        munching on some fruit. A health bar is smartly located on one of your
        hands (much like we saw in Half-Life: Alyx) meaning it’s never more than
        a quick glance away, like checking the time on a watch, and always in
        view when aiming down sights. All in all, the interface of Call of the
        Mountain is very cleverly implemented, making it feel like a tangible
        part of your character and not a series of distracting floating boxes
        that threaten to take you out of the beautiful world.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Puzzles also pop up here and there and, again, serve as a welcome break
        from climbing. Did I mention there’s a lot of climbing? The problems are
        sometimes fun but never overly difficult, and once the novelty of
        actually physically picking up gears and slotting them into position
        myself wore out they became yet another minor obstacle on the way to the
        next combat encounter or story moment.
        <br /><br />
        That story is serviceable, but one that is definitely engineered in
        order to facilitate big moments and fun cameos rather than tell a
        layered tale itself the way the previous two Horizons have. Here you
        play as Ryas rather than Aloy – he’s a Shadow Carja rebel who must
        complete a series of tasks in order to atone for his crimes. His
        internal monologues are mercifully limited in a smart maneuver that
        allows you to experience this world first-hand yourself and not be
        distracted by voices in your head.
        <br /><br />
        Naturally, things escalate as the plot thickens, and the second half of
        the campaign becomes much more engaging than the first thanks to the
        action increasing in both quality and quantity. A personal highlight is
        the aforementioned Thunderjaw cat and mouse section, which conjures up
        memories of Jurassic Park at its rousing best. There are a few little
        nods scattered throughout for big Horizon fans to find of value here –
        familiar faces like Aloy drop in to say hello – but don’t necessarily
        come in expecting a dense new chapter in this universe’s lore.
        <br /><br />
        Outside the main story you’re free to explore your small home base, take
        a closer look at artifacts collected on your expeditions, and chat with
        friends made along the way. It’s also home to the pleasant safari mode:
        a largely tranquil alternative version of the opening boat cruise which
        shows off a selection of the Horizon bestiary in its natural habitat.
        It’s short, sweet, and a reflection of the Disneyland-like nature of
        Call of the Mountain as a whole – an impressive technical showcase for
        PS VR2 which uses the inherent wonders of the Horizon world to sprinkle
        thrills into its sometimes-lazy river ride.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Horizon Call of the Mountain’s exciting highs elevate it just enough
        above its often monotonous climbing mechanics to create a fun first
        blockbuster-scale entry into the PS VR2 library. Through intuitive
        design, awesome spectacle, and gripping combat, Horizon’s first step
        into virtual reality is one packed with exciting encounters that its
        slower stretches may sometimes detract from, but never threaten to
        derail completely. It’s an enjoyable, if not essential, chapter of the
        Horizon story.
