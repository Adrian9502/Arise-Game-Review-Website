      <p>
        Destiny 2 succeeds where the original failed the most: its delivery of a
        story-driven campaign good enough to match its finely tuned first-person
        shooter gameplay and great looks. Gathering loot and upgrades through
        missions and activities with my Fireteam and then finally running the
        climactic Raid together was a blast. And every time I thought my friends
        and I were scraping the bottom of the content barrel, Destiny 2 teased
        us with more that was just a few Light levels away.
        <br /><br />
        From the opening moments, Destiny 2 delivers Dominus Ghaul, an excellent
        antagonist whose cruelty earns our fury by taking away everything that
        had been built up in Destiny and its expansions, including our
        Guardians’ Light. The campaign that follows is filled with brilliant
        cutscenes that give the cast an opportunity to show great emotional
        range, and you can hear the sadness and determination in their voices.
        Zavala (played by Lance Reddick) is unwavering in his plan to assault
        Ghaul, while Ikora (Gina Torres) seems distraught and near the point of
        giving up. That context gives both new and returning players a sensible
        reason to climb the Light-level based power ladder, whether for the
        first time or all over again. It kept me moving forward through fun
        missions set in eye-catching environments, including the exhilarating
        penultimate mission.
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, a soaring soundtrack backs pulse-pounding missions before
        shifting gears to evoke a tinge of sadness. The sound design is
        impeccable overall, with rewarding splashes of glimmer each time you
        open a chest or a silencing of the ambient noise when you aim down
        sights. Every adjustment is important, giving you the audio information
        you need instead of overwhelming you with everything at once.
      </p>
      <h2>Bungie’s laid out a wide range of activities.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        To challenge us on the way back to the top, Bungie’s laid out a wide
        range of avenues that include Public Events, PvP (player vs. player) in
        the Crucible, roaming world bosses, treasure chests, Lost Sectors,
        Adventure side-quests, patrols, planet-specific challenges, Flashpoints,
        Vanguard missions, Exotic Quests, Strikes (Destiny’s dungeons,
        basically), the Nightfall (a more elaborate take on Strikes), the
        lengthy campaign, and of course the Leviathan Raid (the biggest, most
        complex dungeon).
        <br /><br />
        Especially early on, there’s so much to do it’s almost overwhelming. I
        found myself frequently getting distracted from the activity I embarked
        upon by something enticing, like a roaming boss or public event that
        promised some quick loot. It’s a good problem to have, in that I never
        felt bored, but keep in mind these all seem targeted toward early Light
        level Guardians. While all of these battles will help get you to level
        265, climbing to the max of 350 (the cap indicated in menu tips) is
        going to require tackling much tougher challenges like Leviathan,
        Nightfall, and Trials of the Nine – the endgame, in other words.
      </p>
      <h2>The final encounter fizzled out a bit.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The campaign was my first priority, since the story had hooked me so
        well. But, after around 10 hours of buildup, the final encounter fizzled
        out a bit. Due to some awkward super ability restrictions, I had to
        resort to finding a safe spot and shooting the ultimate enemy in the
        foot until he died. It seems as though the encounter was meant for
        projectile supers, but without any way of knowing that going in, I
        hadn’t yet earned one that could do effective damage. It was an
        especially odd problem to have because Bungie has in the past shown that
        its Destiny 2 designers know how to make Strikes and Raid bosses
        interesting from a mechanical perspective, making the boss portion of
        the ending a surprising disappointment in what was an otherwise
        fantastic run.
        <br /><br />
        Thankfully, the excellent quests and more elaborate Strikes that
        followed the campaign come with much-improved boss encounters and an
        extra dose of quality lore. After the campaign ends you can still
        experience some new story events via additional Quests on each of the
        four planetoid locations in Destiny 2. These not only flesh out the
        intriguing new characters we’ve met there, but also do a good job of
        guiding you into new spots you may have missed and fun encounters built
        to be played with a three-person Fireteam. They also end with big
        rewards, like Exotic Quests and coveted Legendary items, making them a
        great way to continue your climb to max Light. I’m hoping that Bungie
        doubles down on these with even more quests, either daily or weekly, as
        some left me wanting more.
        <br /><br />
        The four world maps do a fantastic job of setting the tone, too. Whether
        it’s the milky waterfalls of Nessus or the overgrown European Dead Zone,
        each offers a colorful and unique palette to explore as you acquire
        their plentiful loot. Adding to that, there are also items scattered
        throughout each destination offering snippets of lore about the
        location, and gear sets you can acquire by turning in tokens earned from
        the above activities in exchange for reputation at that destination’s
        vendor. Bungie understandably wants to encourage everyone to take all
        this in, but goes a little too far by withholding the fast-moving
        Sparrow bikes for too long in order to force you to walk through it the
        first time (unless you get lucky and get one in a drop or pay for one
        via Bright Engrams).
      </p>
      <h2>“Stay Alert Out There” - Cayde-6</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The first Destiny is a strong first-person shooter built using expertise
        from Bungie’s days developing the Halo series, but subtle touches have
        made a big difference in Destiny 2 when it comes to making
        moment-to-moment combat more explosive and exciting. For example,
        popping an enemy’s shield with the right damage type causes it to hit
        its nearby allies with area-of-effect damage, and scoring a headshot on
        a Fallen treats you to a light show as its soul escapes its body; both
        are welcome bursts of validation, and Destiny 2 dishes out these types
        of visual and gameplay rewards left and right.
      </p>
      <h2>Destiny 2 is full of game-changing items.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        While there aren’t a ton of different weapon types (as you’d see in
        something like Borderlands 2), the constant gear drops and game-changing
        Exotic weapons and upgrades propel your power level higher, creating
        that feeling of growing strength and readiness to take on all
        challengers. When I equipped my Titan with the Actium War Rig Exotic
        chestpiece that automatically reloads a portion of the ammo in your
        assault rifle over time, it increased my damage output dramatically in a
        way that was more interesting than simply boosting the damage value on
        each bullet. Alternatively, The Rat King hand cannon grants you
        invisibility if you reload immediately after a kill. Destiny 2 is full
        of items like these, and earning them feels like an achievement because
        of how much they change your play.
        <br /><br />
        The gear chase has some rocky parts, though, because Destiny 2 doesn’t
        take the time to explain how its upgrade and infusion systems work. Mods
        can be a bit confusing at first because you have to absorb a lot of
        obscure rules. For instance, if the mods are Legendary they’ll add 5
        attack power to your gear; however, if they don’t have a mod attached
        you can still infuse a Rare weapon into a Legendary weapon and see a
        Light level increase. Sound confusing? That’s because it is! But once
        you get acquainted with the math it’s a little more comprehensible. If
        you don’t want to have the same frustration at wasted progress that I
        did, I recommend checking our Destiny 2 wiki guide for tips on how to do
        it efficiently.
        <br /><br />
        Destiny 2’s approach to the Shader system, which allows you to customize
        the colors of your various pieces of gear and weaponry, is also
        confusing and awkward because it encourages you to wait before applying
        any customization to your gear. Instead of a Shader color being
        something reusable which you unlock and then apply to whatever you like,
        they’re now consumables that must be individually earned as loot or
        purchased via the Eververse Trading Company. This feels at odds with
        Destiny 2’s focus on striving to evolve your weapons and armor, and I
        found myself simply holding onto my shaders until I had enough to not
        worry about coloring a piece of gear only to replace it when a better
        item comes along minutes later.
        <br /><br />
        Also purchasable from the Eververse are The Bright Engrams, Destiny 2’s
        version of a premium loot box. They can include items like cosmetically
        different ships, Sparrows (some of which have different stats), mods,
        weapon skins, exotic emotes, and more. It seems like a place where
        Bungie could’ve gone wrong by prodding you to spend real money to get
        more, but so far that doesn’t appear to be the case. You are given free
        Bright Engrams each time you fill up your experience bar after hitting
        character level 20, so you should still feel like they’re in plentiful
        supply even if you opt not to spend money. You can also break down
        Eververse items for dust that will allow you to purchase from a rotating
        inventory of similar items.
        <br /><br />
        Destiny 2’s three character classes – Titan, Warlock, and Hunter – have
        all been simplified relative to Destiny. Each of their subclass trees
        now only include an upper or lower power path with a few grenade,
        jumping, and power options, but that’s enough so that each still has
        distinct abilities and playstyles that work well together in traditional
        tank, support, and damage-dealer roles. Figuring out how to use subtle
        customizations and weapon pairings to make the most of your chosen build
        is still a rewarding puzzle to solve. For example, as a Titan you can
        build into an Arc damage type subclass which could then receive a boost
        from a Warlock that’s using Arc projectiles, if you planned properly.
        The Hunter’s dodge seems underpowered in the early stages, though, since
        the other classes’ abilities have a clearer immediate benefit to the
        team. While the Titan starts with a shield that protects everyone and
        the Warlock has a healing or damage-buff ability, the Hunter is left
        with a relatively weak dodge move that reloads or recharges their melee
        but does nothing for the team. It isn’t until they unlock a certain pair
        of Exotic boots that reload everyone’s ammo can fully contribute to the
        team in a way other than direct damage.
        <br /><br />
        It’s unfortunate that while the first subclass (which allows you to
        specialize your character) is well integrated into the leveling
        experience with a story event of appropriate gravity, others just drop
        like an ordinary piece of loot. It was a missed opportunity to tell a
        story about reacquiring your powers, similar to the way Destiny’s The
        Taken King DLC gifted you with your new abilities. Once done doing world
        events to power up these random pickups things get better, and you
        embark upon on a more interesting quest to get a bit of backstory
        delivered by your Vanguard leader, but these moments don’t compare to
        their grandiose counterparts of Destiny.

      <h2>
        Watching an upward sword strike send your enemy off in the distance will
        never get old.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The biggest change to the overall game balance is a smart adjustment to
        one-hit kill power weapons. For the most part, they’re a blast to use –
        watching an upward sword strike that sends the embers of your enemy
        flickering off in the distance feels like it’ll never get old. In the
        player-vs-environment (PvE) areas, the bright-purple ammo packs that
        power these weapons are in constant supply, letting you frequently lay
        waste to enemies in spectacular fashion. On the other hand, in
        competitive game types power ammo can only be acquired by one team
        member each time it spawns, so you have to make each use count. This
        leads to more powerful moments and fewer cheap deaths.
        <br /><br />
        Thankfully, the more conventional kinetic and energy weapons feel well
        balanced across the board, giving you different archetypes to choose
        from for each weapon type. Suros auto rifles, for example, have a higher
        rate of fire than the Omolon weapons, but reduced range, stability, and
        handling stats. Veist autorifle’s have the highest rate of fire and
        better reload speed, but again at the cost of range and stability. Each
        of the weapon types has these subtle differences, allowing you to create
        loadouts that compliment your character’s armor stats or Exotic
        abilities for the best efficiency possible.

      <h2>“I’ve Got My Eye on You.” - Ikora Rey</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Another major shift from Destiny is that the competitive experience of
        Destiny 2 relies more on team-based tactics, moving away from Destiny’s
        one-man-army style. The time to kill seems much longer because grenades
        and shoulder charges don’t always kill in one hit, and that gives you
        the opportunity to retreat from an encounter when your shields go down,
        like in Halo. That usually works well, since many of the 11 PvP maps (12
        counting the PlayStation exclusive) are well suited for the new
        four-vs-four teams, but a few may be a tad too large. This makes it
        easy, and even strategic, to avoid the other team until you’re forced to
        clash in the center over a capture point, should the match go into
        overtime. But this excess room in certain maps often causes Competitive
        Playlist matches to drag on way too long without action.
        <br /><br />
        Trials of the Nine is the new version of the Trials mode that’s been the
        lifeblood of PvP in Destiny for years, and it includes two different
        modes that alternate every week. The first, Survival, pits you against
        another four-player team to see who can whittle down the other side’s
        pool of lives first (not unlike a Battlefield match), while Countdown
        has you either defending a vital area or attacking and planting a bomb
        in said area (which should sound familiar to Counter-Strike fans). From
        what we’ve experienced in the Competitive Playlist, they’ve been very
        fun with a team once you get started, but it can take an excessively
        long time to find a match due to apparent bugs that Bungie has
        acknowledged are an issue.
        <br /><br />
        Trials of the Nine opens up each weekend and encourages you to enter for
        your chance at Powerful Engram rewards resulting in top-tier gear. It’s
        still seven wins to go to the top of the ladder, which awards you a
        unique cosmetic aura, and you can simply reset your card with the press
        of a button (no more consumables necessary). At first, I was worried the
        departure from Trials of Osiris would be jarring, but it actually felt
        right at home with the same weight and nervousness in each encounter.
        They’ve also given all players a chance to earn rewards by giving tokens
        for participation, and they can be redeemed after your first win. More
        rewards continue to be unlocked until you finally finish off your card.
        It gives everyone something to strive for, regardless of level.

      <h2>
        You aren’t allowed to pick and choose which modes you want to enjoy.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The gray lining to the silver cloud that is Destiny 2’s various
        replayable modes is that you aren’t allowed to pick and choose which
        ones you want to enjoy at any given time. To play a Strike or any of the
        PvP Crucible modes you’re forced to join a queue that dumps you into a
        randomly selected map or mode, which is frustrating when you had a
        specific experience in mind. Worse, there’s no penalty for people who
        drop out and try again upon finding themselves in an undesirable match,
        like Supremacy when they wanted to play Clash. (Unless, of course, you
        count the long load times associated with jumping in and out of Crucible
        matches as a penalty.) That’s left my team and I in half-empty
        multiplayer matches many more times than I’d like.
        <br /><br />
        Also, a downside to bouncing between so many different types of
        activities is that it’s hard to keep a group together. World activities,
        PvP, and Leviathan all have different group size requirements, meaning
        you’re often a person short for some activities or forced to abandon a
        team member when transitioning from the four-player Crucible PvP into a
        three-man team activity like a Strike.
        <br /><br />
        The new Clan system in Destiny 2 does a great job of giving people a
        reason to stick together. Now, our crew of IGN friends and family have
        begun completing team-based objectives and sporting our IGN banners with
        pride as we enter each activity to level up. It’s great seeing your
        Clan’s overall progress increase, and because it gives you a big reward
        for your personal contribution – and smaller rewards for overall clan
        objectives – it’s worth your time to join up with one. I’m looking
        forward to watching the engrams stack up as our Clan completes tasks for
        the week, or I’m able to finish one myself for the team.

      <h2>“I Need My Fireteam.” - Zavala</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The Leviathan Raid and its smaller end-game cousin, The Nightfall, are
        the premiere PvE events of Destiny 2, and so far they’re both successful
        in their purpose of keeping hardcore Destiny players like me coming
        back. The combat-focused Nightfall does this by forcing your
        three-person Fireteam to formulate a plan before going in so you can
        capitalize on whichever of the rotating set of modifiers you happen to
        draw. These can include extra goals like jumping through rings, killing
        enemies, or finding a specific target to increase the time left on the
        countdown clock, and they add a new level of challenge to each run,
        especially if you’re attempting to complete some of the harder quests at
        the same time. There’s a lot of skill and strategy that goes into
        running The Nightfall, and that makes it highly replayable.
      </p>
      <h2>In addition to the nice loot drop, we’d made a new friend.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        To help anyone who ventures into Destiny 2 without a team experience
        this endgame content, Bungie has introduced a clever feature called
        Guided Games (currently in beta, but so far working great for us) that
        allow experienced teams to queue into a system that brings along a new
        player (with a microphone – it’s required) to teach them the ropes.
        After hopping in as a host, one other IGN clan member and I teamed up
        with a new friend who hadn’t played through The Nightfall in the past.
        In addition to the nice loot drop at the end and an emblem recognizing
        our helping a new player, we’d made a new friend. I hope that Bungie
        continues to foster this type of positive community engagement.
        <br /><br />
        But the biggest, baddest PvE activity is Destiny 2’s Leviathan Raid,
        which continues to live up to Bungie’s high standards of new and varied
        puzzles and challenging boss battles that require teams of six
        well-coordinated players to pull off. I love how Leviathan immediately
        mixes up what you may expect from a Destiny Raid encounter and adds
        cutscenes showing off your Fireteam of six guardians.
        <br /><br />
        Now, I’ll briefly discuss Raid mechanics, so if you don’t want to know
        anything at all about the Leviathan Raid before going in, please skip
        over the next two paragraphs.
        <br /><br />
        Leviathan opens like most, forcing your team into a gauntlet-like
        activity where you need to plant flags in the ground to proceed. You
        then fight through three encounters before a final boss. This time,
        however, the encounters are varied and add new ways to fight, like one
        room where you’re forced to rely on stealth, and another that makes you
        run a gauntlet with a bomb as your team shoots arrows allowing you to
        proceed. Each experience forces your team into two groups and each
        forces you to work together to a common goal after you’ve met the
        requirements to enter, and it’s a clever approach that felt both
        challenging and distinct from any I’ve done before.
        <br /><br />
        The architecture on display is a castle covered in ornate gold designs
        and mysterious machinery, leaving you to wonder who built it and why
        were you invited in? You learn some of those answers upon completion,
        and that lore reward added to my sense of accomplishment. And unlike
        Destiny’s previous Raids, this one dishes out some interesting story
        revelations, too. After completion you’re encouraged to return to find
        the treasure chests you’re given keys for as you clear each section, and
        there are additional secret chests you can unlock in the areas below the
        main arena. Should you not wish to return, you’ll still have tokens you
        can turn in for a chance at powerful Legendary weapons and a unique
        armor set for each class. Visually, it’s massive in scope as you
        scramble to the tops of an incredible building and still have the
        workings below to explore.

        A few bugs forced us and other Raid teams to restart several times.

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        A few bugs that forced us and other Raid teams to restart several times
        sullied my otherwise amazing experience, but Bungie says it’s working to
        address that issue. Also in the category of known issues still awaiting
        a fix as of this writing are crashes affecting PlayStation 4 Pro users
        playing in 4K – we’ve seen a few of those on the IGN staff.
        <br /><br />
        With all of that content, there are 30 to 40 hours of great gameplay
        waiting for you in Destiny 2 before the Raid. When you approach max
        Light level, though, there are only a few activities that someone who
        loves the level climb like I do can participate in to get Raid-ready. I
        wish that more Adventures had an additional incentive, such as a reward
        for completing all of them on a given destination or a Powerful Engram
        for completing a particular set that told an interesting story. It’s
        unfortunate that most progression is tied to Public Events, as they give
        a huge experience drop for each heroic completed and they spawn so
        frequently. Even the weekly Flashpoints consist of simply completing
        Public Events on a certain planet.
        <br /><br />
        That said, once you’re ready for the Leviathan Raid you can hop in and
        tackle its many challenges for loot. Once completed, Quests like the
        Destroyer of Worlds line will advance, allowing you to enter an
        extra-challenging Strike mission.
        <br /><br />
        Bungie has promised that Destiny 2 will continue to evolve with a
        roadmap of content on the way that already includes Trials of the Nine
        added today, and Faction Rally on September 26. Looking into October,
        they’ve already teased the Prestige difficulty Raid and Iron Banner,
        another popular PvP mode for competitive players. Hopefully, Bungie can
        keep up this cadence as the additions so far have been expansive. Time
        will tell if Iron Banner and Faction Wars can keep up the same level of
        excitement as a Raid.

      <h2>Overall, the PC is the best platform on which to play Destiny 2.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        But overall, the PC is the best platform on which to play Destiny 2.
        Options like key remapping, intuitive controller support (including
        separate tuning for controller vs. keyboard and mouse that makes each
        feel like a competent option), and a field-of-view slider allow you to
        build an experience customized exactly to your liking.
        <br /><br />
        There is a concern that aim assist for controllers might be used by
        cheaters to gain an advantage in PvP by fooling Destiny 2 into thinking
        they’re using a gamepad when they’re actually on a mouse, but thankfully
        we have yet to encounter anything that suggests that’s a real problem
        rather than a theoretical one. Time will tell if this becomes a rampant,
        but meanwhile, Bungie appears to be committed to keeping the PC free of
        cheaters to the point where it’s potentially a detriment. Bungie has
        implemented a strict lockdown on what you can do while you’re playing
        because of a fear of cheats. The official site warns that third-party
        applications like Discord, OBS Game Capture can be used with
        restrictions, and anything that puts an overlay over the gameplay other
        than Nvidia Shadowplay or AMD ReLive could potentially cause problems.
        <br /><br />
        That said, those restrictions haven’t impacted my experience while
        playing with my friends so far. We opened Discord in the background and
        were able to chat freely. When using OBS I did run into difficulties
        when trying to take screenshots, but when streaming software was turned
        off everything I typically use worked as intended.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Destiny 2 is a blast out of the gate thanks to its excellent co-op
        shooter gameplay and strong storytelling in the campaign. Not all the
        features I’d expected to find are here, but it does deliver the same
        kind of highly social gameplay and rewarding, loot-driven progression
        that helped the original keep me hooked for hundreds of hours. The main
        concerns right now are a few bugs and lack of event options, but I’ll
        definitely be sticking around to see this big, action-packed universe
        develop over time.
