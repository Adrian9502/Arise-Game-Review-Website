      <p>
        It has been 16 years since STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl. That means it’s
        also been 16 years since I last played a STALKER game. I admired the
        original but never loved its wonky, ambitious heart enough to explore
        its two follow-ups. But despite that decade-plus time away from the
        series, when I sat down to play STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl at
        gamescom 2023 it felt like I’d never been away. As if reactivating a
        long-dormant muscle, I found its creeping pace and scrappy gunfights
        instantly familiar. That’s good news for devout fans of the cult PC
        series, but perhaps more of a challenge for the potential legion of
        newcomers that will arrive at launch via Game Pass.
        <br /><br />
        Despite its Unreal Engine 5 base and prominent Microsoft support, the
        fifteen-minute gamescom demo suggests that STALKER 2 still sits in the
        ‘eurojank’ category; the colloquial term for eastern European games that
        are overly ambitious and technically wobbly. This sequel’s animations
        are stiff, its human faces look like haunted waxworks, the AI struggles
        to stay smart, and inventory management is fiddly. But in exchange for
        that you get a Soviet bloc world that feels authentic and layered with
        opportunity. This demo may have been short, but its small areas featured
        numerous angles for stealth or action approaches, fun flanking routes,
        and a variety of side objectives.
        <br /><br />
        My sample misadventure through the rusted carcass that is the Chornobyl
        Exclusion Zone begins with a rabid dog mauling away at my ankles. The
        mutt is dispatched by kicking it into an anomaly; the rippling miniature
        storms that litter STALKER’s world. The dog explodes into a dozen gory
        chunks, demonstrating that these anomalies are to be steered well clear
        of. I’m also given some bolts, which can be thrown into anomalies from a
        safe distance to cause them to erupt and open up a safe path. These
        storms don’t turn up again for the rest of the demo, but I hope in the
        full game they fulfil a dual role as environmental hazard puzzles and
        traps to lure enemies into.
        <br /><br />
        Further down the road I discover a man fighting off more of those
        mutated dogs. My over-cautious nature sees me blast a hole in the side
        of his head (why would I trust anyone in this god-forsaken place?),
        which results in a notification that I’ve failed an optional objective.
        Thankfully I’m able to reload the demo and approach in a more friendly
        manner, but this slip-up shows off STALKER 2’s push for realism; NPCs
        are not safe from stray or purposeful shots, and objectives will change
        with their fates.
        <br /><br />
        With the dogs dispatched on this fresh attempt, I have a quick chat with
        the survivor and his injured friend. The conversation really highlights
        STALKER 2’s graphical limitations; these characters look like Bethesda
        NPCs from the previous generation and move with a similar lack of grace.
        Beyond this room, the wider world feels a lot like a cutting-edge PC
        game from ten years ago; still detailed and sharp in a grungy way that
        suits the decayed setting, but clearly not of the modern era. Graphics
        are obviously not a vital part of the experience, but considering its
        next-gen exclusivity and Unreal Engine 5 foundations, I did expect
        STALKER 2 to be more of a looker.
      </p>
      <h2>
        These are tense, dirty firefights with plenty of character and just a
        dash of fear.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The survivors, named Zhorik and Gloomy, turn out to be fellow STALKERs
        who have been attacked by bandits. Zhorik laments that their attackers
        have seized the nearby boiler house. I volunteer to take on the bandits,
        knowing it will be the ideal testing ground for the combat systems. It
        turns out to be a pretty classic outpost-style location; a building and
        courtyard arrangement surrounded by a perimeter wall. A gateway provides
        a direct route in, but crumbling brickwork to the side signals an
        alternate route in for a stealthier approach. I duck through the hole
        and behind a large fuel drum, peering beneath it to spy on the
        patrolling bandits. And then, one slightly fumbled headshot later, I’m
        thrust into a skirmish that feels completely true to the origins of the
        series.
        <br /><br />
        STALKER 2’s guns are snappy and punchy in the way you’d expect of
        firearms that have survived being lugged around a rusting world. But, in
        an approach that puts them a world apart from weapons in modern
        shooters, they feel almost entirely unreliable. In Call of Duty, if you
        shoot an enemy in the head, that enemy is dead, and you even get a
        visual and audio cue to confirm that. STALKER 2, in keeping with both
        its predecessor and real life, offers no such feedback. Bullet spread is
        difficult to predict, and that gets trickier at longer ranges. It makes
        for tense, dirty firefights with plenty of character and just a dash of
        fear. There are very few games like this on the modern FPS scene,
        especially on consoles, and I admire that developer GSC Game World is
        doubling down on its unique flavour.
        <br /><br />
        But, as with everything in this demo, the good comes with the jank. The
        bandits are not exactly the sharpest tools in the zone, and spend their
        time either bumbling in the open or glued to cover. I hope that in the
        months between now and launch, GSC can sharpen the AI's senses. This is
        not to say that they are incapable of being a danger in their current
        state; I’m unceremoniously gunned down on my first attempt at clearing
        the camp. This does highlight STALKER 2’s approach to death, though,
        which resurrects me a few metres outside the boiler house and keeps the
        world state intact. I’d much rather death send me back to a previous
        save and allow me a fresh attempt at a challenge.
        <br /><br />
        With the bandits cleaned up, a voice on my radio informs me of an
        incoming ‘emission’, and advises that I take cover. I sprint through the
        woods in search of a building and eventually find my way into a shabby
        cabin just as my Geiger counter goes into overdrive. Through a gap in
        the roof I watch as the sky turns a vibrant red, pierced occasionally by
        searing forks of white lightning. My subsequent death amid the unending
        rattle of radiation warnings signals the end of my short demo, but this
        concluding moment hints at emissions being regular occurrences that will
        force you to drop whatever you’re doing and run for your life. I hope
        the AI is as responsive to these situations as you need to be, because
        the idea of battles breaking out as characters fight for access to
        radiation-safe buildings is a thrilling one.
        <br /><br />
        And that’s all I saw. This was an incredibly short and simple demo for
        what is presumably – based on its predecessors, at least – going to be a
        fairly complex FPS. I’m left wondering what the bigger picture is, how
        the systems interlink and overlap, and how flexible its combat
        encounters are. But what I did learn from this slim sample is that
        STALKER 2 feels somewhat of a remake of the original game. Not
        physically – everything here is new. But spiritually and mechanically,
        this slice felt almost exactly like my memories of the 2007 original.
        <br /><br />
        Heart of Chornobyl’s old-school approach is great news for the original
        game’s dedicated fanbase, but I’m not sure what it means for more
        mainstream players who are being coaxed into its orbit by Microsoft’s
        big Game Pass push. They are likely better served by Metro: Exodus, the
        other Soviet bloc shooter that – despite being four years old – feels
        more modern than anything in this demo. But for those with a tolerance
        for rough edges and a hunger for something that’s unlike anything in the
        contemporary console space, STALKER 2 could be something to keep an eye
        on. We’ll need a much more substantial demo to truly know if it’s worth
        being excited about, though.
