      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        At first I was afraid, I was petrified – I kept thinking "how could
        Respawn follow up on its outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?" But
        then I spent so many nights playing the sequel finding out how they got
        it right and Cal Kestis grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And
        now we’re back, in outer space… okay, okay, don’t leave! I’ll stop. The
        point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open
        maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff
        to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways
        the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order’s Arkham Asylum. And much like
        the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures
        playing as a Force user quite as well as this.
        <br /><br />
        Especially considering that there’s no reason not to go back and play
        Fallen Order before starting Survivor if you haven’t, I greatly
        appreciate that the sequel starts you out with most of the powers and
        upgrades that Cal had already acquired – there’s no corny amnesia or
        other, “Oh no, my powers are gone!” gimmick to make you re-learn how to
        double-jump or use Force push, and no Jawas snuck up and stole away the
        climbing claws that make scaling walls much faster or the Scomp Link
        that lets BD-1 hack things. Outside of having to earn back your healing
        canisters and life and Force bar extensions, this is more or less Cal as
        we left him five years prior.
        <br /><br />
        So we’re already off to an exciting running start when things kick off
        with a brief caper on Imperial Coruscant that calls back to A New Hope
        before making a thrilling escape. You’re quickly thrown right back into
        Force-pushing Storm Troopers off of ledges and chaining together
        movement tricks like wall-running, climbing, swinging, and sliding down
        ramps. And that’s just the beginning – the Spider-Man-style grapple
        (which only works on pre-designated points) is introduced before you
        leave Coruscant, and the unlocks keep coming from there on at a
        rewarding pace. When you unlock the mid-air dash ability to pair with
        your double-jump, things really take off – you can cover such crazy
        distances without touching the ground, changing directions twice to
        reach things around corners, that I had to completely rethink what was
        possible. It’s not as though Survivor invented the air dash, but Respawn
        makes excellent use of it, further flexing those Titanfall muscles.
        <br /><br />
        Moving around is definitely satisfying but lightsabers are, of course,
        the stars of the war. Survivor kicks up the excellent dueling from
        Fallen Order by several notches with five different fighting stances
        that are all brilliantly animated to create some of the flashiest and
        fiercest Star Wars melee battles I’ve ever seen. You don’t even have to
        be all that good at nailing the timing of strikes, parries, and dodges
        for fights to look spectacular and smooth as you carve a swath through
        enemies (but if you are it looks even cooler), and the fact that arms
        and legs can now sometimes get severed from Storm Troopers and other
        humanoids – not just droids and creatures, who get absolutely shredded –
        makes it feel more gratifyingly powerful than ever during kill
        animations.
      </p>
      <h2>Lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        After dabbling in the single, double-bladed, and dual-wielding stances
        that carry over from Fallen Order, I settled on the two new ones: the
        Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard style and the hybrid Blaster stance that
        answers the question of “wouldn’t it be cool if Han Solo were also a
        Jedi?” The Crossguard treats your lightsaber as a slow and heavy
        broadsword that’s great for hammering a stunned target into the floor,
        while the latter equips you with a sidearm to dispatch small enemies
        without having to close the gap and sure makes short work of
        flamethrower troopers, packs of animals, or others who like to get in
        close. It’s, quite literally, a blast. Of course, once I unlocked the
        ability to throw my Crossguard saber to hit enemies a little farther
        away I felt like either stance was capable of taking down just about any
        enemy when needed and settled in for the ride. These sabers pair nicely
        with the expanded set of Force powers that allow you to do things like
        pull in an entire group of enemies close before executing a spinning
        slash to cut them all down like blades of grass.
        <br /><br />
        You can only equip two of the five stances at any given time, which at
        first seemed artificially limiting – and it is, when you think about it
        – but I came to appreciate it because it gave my version of Cal more
        personality as a fighter. You can, of course, swap out your stances at
        any meditation circle, but especially in the early hours you only have
        so many skill points to go around (and only one free respec). Each
        stance has its own skill tree, so you’re encouraged to specialize, and
        by the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear
        favorites, and no regrets.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        It’s a story that does the job it needs to do well: get you from one
        exciting action scene to the next. Early on and quite literally by
        falling into it by accident, Cal finds himself in a race to locate
        what’s effectively a map to a lost treasure planet. That’s very much in
        keeping with the idea of him as the Nathan Drake of the Star Wars
        universe, and leads to plenty of excuses to visit ancient (well, old and
        abandoned at least) puzzle chambers where you have to use your wits, the
        Force, and an expanded range of gadgetry to solve them. Importantly for
        a game like this, it seldom feels like there’s a lot of time pressure to
        rush to the next objective, so taking a detour on a side quest to
        investigate missing prospectors in a mine, find out what went wrong in a
        droid factory, or investigating the many other rumors you’re presented
        with by locals doesn’t feel like you’re neglecting a responsibility to
        save the galaxy.
        <br /><br />
        Despite being a largely enjoyable adventure, my main issue with the
        story is that nearly every big twist is foreshadowed so heavily that it
        was only ever a matter of when a reveal would happen, not if. The
        identities of the main villains are secret as of now, and shall remain
        unspoiled here, but they’re pretty easy to see coming a lightyear away.
        In any case, at least they’re written and acted with enough depth that
        they don’t feel like retreads of anyone Cal’s faced before, and neither
        is a two-dimensional Sith Lord who somehow has returned. There’s more to
        them than that, as Survivor successfully prioritizes character over plot
        for the most part.
      </p>
      <h2>The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force.</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force to go
        through those motions, and this time Cameron Monaghan’s Cal is not so
        easily outshined by the crew of the Mantis. His motivations are about
        more than simply fighting the Empire now: it’s about whether he can live
        a life where he’s something more than a resistance fighter, let go of
        his guilt, and find a home that’s safe. His path after escaping Order 66
        is contrasted against what could’ve been if he’d had different
        priorities and made different choices. That gives him a lot more
        character growth than he had as purely a traumatized fugitive learning
        to be a Jedi. His decisions have more weight to them, making him a much
        more realized protagonist this time around.
        <br /><br />
        Naturally, BD-1 never left Cal’s side, but the rest of the crew are all
        given very human reasons for their parting ways after Fallen Order and
        why they’re coming back together now. Greez’s loveable cantankerousness
        made him a favorite, and he’s happy to deliver more of that along with
        some sage wisdom while carefully avoiding overuse of his “grab some
        seat” catchphrase as he pilots the Mantis. Merrin returns with a new
        look to immediately rekindle some of the romantic chemistry between
        herself and Cal, and her more casual attitude after having traveled the
        galaxy makes her even more endearing. And though she’s less of a
        constant presence due to Cal no longer needing a mentor, the
        ever-intense Cere is more powerful than ever, and that power is
        displayed memorably in one of Survivor’s biggest action moments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from a large cast of colorful alien side characters, including an
        ancient protocol droid with a loose screw and a goofy sea slug with a
        reverse diving suit and a thick Scottish accent, the other new member of
        the group is Bode. He’s another roguish mercenary type who, much like
        Cal did in Fallen Order, initially comes across somewhat blandly as the
        two bro it up to establish the friendship they’ve struck up fighting the
        Empire together. As his sympathetic backstory is fleshed out, however,
        he does become a more interesting companion.
        <br /><br />
        Getting to fight alongside allies on certain story missions this time
        around is a treat, especially watching Merrin use her Nightcrawler-esque
        teleportation to blink around the battle and pick off targets (riding
        her coattails leads to Jedi Survivor’s single most thrilling action
        sequence). They can’t be killed or downed in action so there’s no
        management or babysitting you have to do, but if you want to, you can
        have them prioritize an especially annoying raider to keep them busy
        while you thin out his friends’ ranks. Beyond that, they’re only really
        used to open up paths for you to reach new areas, which boils down to
        you pushing a button when prompted, but their banter and companionship
        definitely liven up the scenes in a way BD-1’s adorable bleeps and
        bwoops couldn’t do alone.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Survivor takes advantage of that fact that it takes place at the
        midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        Of course, with new friends must also come enemies (it made sense in my
        head, at least), and following a whole game of battling mostly Imperial
        Inquisitors it’s a relief to see that the Empire’s role here is more in
        the background. Their parade of trooper types and security droids are
        mostly here to provide variety after you’ve been fighting the main enemy
        army of raiders and their salvaged Separatist battle droids. It’s a
        clever way to plausibly merge the original trilogy and prequel trilogy
        enemies together into the same game – one that takes advantage of the
        fact that Survivor takes place at nearly the exact midpoint between
        Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.
        <br /><br />
        There’s also no shortage of beasts that resemble what we saw in Fallen
        Order – no matter where you go in the Star Wars galaxy, it seems life
        finds a way to make giant bugs and big angry wampas. It’s a good mix of
        enemies and subtypes that builds on Fallen Order’s already respectable
        lineup, and when I found myself in the middle of a fray where different
        factions are battling it out (including any weak-minded foes I’d
        temporarily Force-confused to my side) it’s a great time.
        <br /><br />
        On the subject of creatures, one of Cal’s many new abilities is to tame
        non-aggressive animals to be rideable mounts, though that isn’t ever
        used for much besides galloping across empty areas slightly faster than
        Cal could’ve run on foot. Given that running doesn’t drain his stamina,
        it seems that it’s mostly just for atmosphere and to make people stop
        asking Respawn if they can ride the animals. Granted, it is pretty cool
        to watch the towering, long-legged spamel carry you across the deserts
        of Jedah. (Yes, they really called an alien camel a spamel.) There’s
        also a flying animal that can be used as a glider, though only at very
        specific points, so it’s not much of a game-changer either, but it does
        play nicely into environmental puzzles.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order achieved and wall-runs
        with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic
        lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin
        Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a
        full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman
        mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger,
        more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast
        of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable
        but is still fun and at times emotional to watch play out. Launch
        performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything
        better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars
        game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll complete the best Star
        Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down.
