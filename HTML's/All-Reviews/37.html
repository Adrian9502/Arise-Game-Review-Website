      <p>
        I spent the majority of my six-hour playthrough of Hellblade: Senua’s
        Sacrifice grasping for a touchstone to understand the experience. It
        unfolds like a beautiful, dark, tense visual novel, placing the
        excellently raw, human performance of its main character front and
        center on her journey into the land of the Northmen. Her story is one of
        confusion, sadness, fear, and loss, and it’s punctuated by moments of
        beauty, and strength that has left a lasting impression on me.
        <br /><br />
        It follows the titular Senua, a celtic warrior, who embarks on a mission
        to the homeland of the Northmen in order to penetrate the depths of
        their version of hell, the mythological Norse land of the dead called
        Helheim. It's bound by threads of historical fiction, historical
        non-fiction, mythology, and metaphor all admirably weaved together to
        create a unique backdrop that's ripe for exploring the darker tones and
        themes Hellblade tackles.
        <br /><br />
        But as impressive as its story is, Ninja Theory’s smart design
        reinforces the sensory nature of the harrowing tale through subtle and
        intuitive mechanics. Even before the game begins, you're prompted to
        play with headphones in order to capitalize on the binaural audio design
        (simulated three-dimensional sound). This is used to great effect as the
        voices that plague Senua are in a constant chatter, dancing around her
        head in creepy ways that feel as though you're never alone.
      </p>

        Voices that plague Senua are in a constant chatter, dancing around her
        head in creepy ways that feel as though you're never alone.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And in truth, you never really are alone in Hellblade, for better or
        worse. These voices speak directly to Senua, each other, and perhaps
        even to you. They impart advice, they argue about her actions, they tear
        her down and pick her up at the best and most inopportune times. This
        fact, coupled with the excellent original score, the never-faltering
        voice work, and the ambient sounds both real and imagined make for an
        audial experience that's as vivid and liberal as anything that happens
        before your eyes.
        <br /><br />
        Visually Hellblade is a gorgeous game to take in – sun-soaked rocky
        beaches, vividly distorted streaks of color and light, and deep darkness
        that strangles the screen, there's a variety of hues, saturation, and
        exposures that convey meaning in most areas. This variety is further
        improved when playing on the PS4 Pro, which makes use of an "enhanced
        resolution" or a smoother, more immersive 60 frames-per-second.
        <br /><br />
        And while Ninja Theory is no stranger to including full-motion video in
        the past (Enslaved's use of Andy Serkis comes to mind), Hellblade's use
        takes it to another degree by splicing in real footage of secondary
        characters' performances through a heavily distorted filter that creates
        impactful scenes between real and animated characters without feeling
        out of place. I was consistently, pleasantly surprised by the number of
        ways Ninja Theory was able to present these moments, all without
        breaking the immersion of the world and story.
        <br /><br />
        Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to
        convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and
        delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that
        rarely ever grapples over whether it’s a game or a story.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Hellblade revolves around Senua’s perception of her environment, drawing
        connections between her beliefs and the geometry of the world.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        For example, there’s no HUD in Hellblade - yet that chorus of voices
        shout panicked advice at Senua in the heat of battle. "Behind you!" one
        of them screams seconds before an enemy stabs at Senua's back. There’s
        no combat tutorial either. Your first moments of do-or-die battle begin
        without warning. There’s no objective markers or mini map, which are
        only occasionally frustrating when backtracking to look for the
        collectible lorestones scattered throughout the world. Hellblade is a
        game that you’re not supposed to trust, because what you see, or hear,
        or feel, is rarely truthful. And because of that there are moments of
        terrifying tension that gave me an amount of anxiety and panic that’s
        borderline uncomfortable.
        <br /><br />
        For example, in one section I guided Senua through a pitch-black area
        filled with shapeless hair-raising creatures that would lunge out when
        she got too close. These moments evoke the vibes of a horror game that
        are sparse enough to be shocking when I haplessly wandered into them,
        but effective enough that I worried for Senua's safety with that
        ever-present nagging of permanent death.
        <br /><br />
        Yet most of Hellblade revolves around Senua’s perception of her
        environment, drawing connections between her beliefs and the geometry of
        the world. You’ll scour each area, lining up beams, or trees, so the
        shapes of the world around her take on significance and unlock the next
        door that blocks her progression. As new puzzle elements are slowly
        added – like fractured walkways and doors that require a precise viewing
        angle to be reassembled, or portals that force you to enter entirely
        different versions of the world – these puzzles take on new layers of
        depth, and meaning.
      </p>
      <h2>
        These moments are profoundly rewarding when you uncover something new.
      </h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        And many of these moments are profoundly rewarding when you uncover
        something new – like a hidden path that can only been seen through a
        specific portal – because they're reinforced by the story that's made
        all this impossibility plausible.
        <br /><br />
        Surprisingly, combat in Hellblade is more of a palate cleanser than a
        core element. It punctuates the story with wave-based enemies that block
        progress until defeated, making use of Senua's light attack, heavy
        attack, parry, dodge, and charge. Though these moves do combine together
        to create a varied enough skill set when facing the same half-dozen
        enemy types, progression feels stunted since new abilities only slightly
        modify the core of the combat, rather than redefine it.
        <br /><br />
        The simple nature of the combat design struck me as obligatory for the
        sake of interactivity – giving you another way to interact with the
        world outside of perception – coupled with the fact a warrior should be
        defined by battle. But there were only a few fights where large groups
        of enemies were thrown at me that I ever felt threatened and it's only
        near the end of the journey when enemy numbers and difficulty spike
        unexpectedly that the combat depth eventually becomes more than the sum
        of its parts.
        <br /><br />
        And yet, like most of Hellblade, combat is still a tense experience
        knowing that dying too many times (in or out of combat) will cause your
        save to be deleted and you’ll be forced to start from the beginning.
        While that might sound draconian in execution, its tie-ins to the story
        are concrete, reinforcing a system where failure carries meaning rather
        than simply acting like a gimmick to artificially inflate difficulty.
        And though I don't think I ever got close to having my save data
        destroyed, every time I got close to dying carried much more weight and
        impact with this knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a masterclass of atmosphere,
        storytelling, and the marriage of mechanical and conceptual design.
        While there are moments that feel shoehorned in to remind us we’re
        playing a video game, the care and attention Ninja Theory has clearly
        poured into Senua and her story has created something amazing. This is a
        game everyone should play, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to have
        lived inside the mind of Senua, however briefly.
