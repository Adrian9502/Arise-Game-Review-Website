      <span class="author"> BY TRAVIS NORTHUP </span>
      <p>
        Stiff arming its way through the crowded battle royale genre, Fortnite
        Battle Royale sets itself apart by trading the traditional, bland
        military simulation vibe with vivid colors and an outstanding, freeform
        building system that’s unlike anything else in competitive multiplayer
        games.As its name suggests, Fortnite Battle Royale fits so neatly into
        the battle royale genre that blew up last year that the basic
        description sounds as standard as you can get: Up to 100 players are
        dropped onto a large but constantly shrinking map with the goal of
        gathering weapons and gear to become the last person or team left
        standing. But if you look just a little closer, it can’t be mistaken for
        any other game because the vehicle you’re skydiving out of is,
        inexplicably, a flying party bus – a nice change of pace from a drab
        military plane – and the place you land is a giant, beautifully colorful
        island, instead of a realistic landscape, surrounded by a violent storm.
        <br /><br />
        Thankfully, unlike other battle royale games, like PlayerUnknown’s
        Battlegrounds, where an unlucky circle could leave getting out of the
        encroaching circle almost impossible, Fortnite’s map is at least small
        enough (relative to PUBG’s) that even if you have to run across the
        entire island to get to the safety of the randomly centered eye of the
        storm you run very little risk of being killed by the collapsing border.
        <br /><br />
        On the island are several large and totally unique cities, each with
        their own style of structures — a quaint suburb of houses, a giant
        office district filled with skyscrapers, or a retail area with an
        outdoor mall. Each city is full of vibrant colors, and the map as a
        whole has hundreds of buildings with randomly spawning loot in the form
        of guns, explosives, and healing items.
        <br /><br />
        Wait, Which Fortnite Is This? Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite was
        originally conceived as a third-person, co-op, survival game where teams
        of players could mine resources and build structures to hold off hordes
        of undead enemies. That version, now a standalone game called Fortnite
        Save the World, still exists, but it’s not great. But as the battle
        royale genre started to gain popularity early in 2017, Epic adapted its
        survival game’s basic systems into something new: Fortnite Battle
        Royale, a separate, free-to-play game that feels like the perfect home
        for Save the World’s wayward mechanics.
        <br /><br />
        Fortnite Battle Royale’s inventory management is, thankfully, simple by
        design. You get just five slots, so you’re forced to balance your
        arsenal of guns with your need for healing or explosives to deal with
        enemy structures. It’s a neat limiting factor that forced me to keep a
        mental shopping list of exactly what I was on the lookout for as I ran
        across the island, and to resist the urge to pick up anything else. With
        such specific needs in mind, every chest came with the thrill of hoping
        it would reveal the weapons I wanted most. Fortnite gives you plenty of
        ways to mix and match weapons, so even if that chest doesn’t come up
        with the exact item you want, you’ll never feel powerless in a fight.
        <br /><br />
        Once you do find the weapons you’re looking for, most fights in Fortnite
        go about the same way: You start with one shot from a slow-firing heavy
        weapon like a sniper rifle or pump shotgun in hopes of ending the fight
        before it really started, then (if needed) switch over to a faster
        assault rifle or tactical shotgun to carry out the rest of the battle.
        While it’s far from the only way to play, this combination seems to be
        the preferred method for almost every player and provides the foundation
        of almost every fight in Fortnite.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a lightning-fast system where fights can end in the blink of an eye
        with just one slight miss. This makes for a stark contrast from other
        battle royale games like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, which is filled
        with long, tense standoffs where sustained accuracy often matters more
        than a single well placed shot. It’s a chaotic and fun system that makes
        fights a little more complicated than simply aiming at your opponent and
        firing, but after a few hours with Fortnite I started to get the
        shoot-and-switch rhythm down and fights started to become almost
        automatic.
        <br /><br />
        It’s the stuff around the shooting that helps Fortnite differentiate
        itself from every other battle royale game and shows off what truly
        makes it special: The building.
        <br /><br />
        Carrying over the building system from Save the World is a brilliant
        choice that sets Battle Royale apart not just from other battle royale
        games, but most competitive multiplayer games in general. Just about
        everything that isn’t the ground can be mined for wood, stone, or steel,
        which can be used to create walls, stairs, and floors anywhere on the
        map (so long as some part of the structure touches the ground). It’s a
        massive system with so many possibilities that, at first blush, it can
        be daunting to try to figure out how to build the massive structures
        that others around you have created. But that’s one of the best things
        about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
        <br /><br />
        With just three primary tiles – floors, walls, and stairs – the building
        toolset may seem limited, but it’s got everything you really need.
        Whether it was building a staircase up to that hard-to-reach loot chest
        or quickly laying down an impromptu piece of cover to protect from an
        attacking enemy, I found I always had the tools I needed for the job at
        hand, and I could swap to the piece I needed without missing a beat. In
        fact, that swapping is so easy that one of my favorite moves is placing
        one platform and jumping off of it, then switch to another type in
        mid-air and place it before I land. That trick allows you to scale
        vertical walls or go straight up a mountain. While this may sound like
        an impressive feat of dexterity, Fortnite makes it so simple that almost
        anyone can pull it off – and they do, making it one of the most common
        tricks to getting around the island.
        <br /><br />
        The first time I really understood how Fortnite’s building and shooting
        played into one another came in the middle of a fight in Retail Row, one
        of the map’s many cities. Another player and I were sheepishly taking
        shots at one another from behind single walls we had built. After I ran
        out of ammo in my assault rifle, I was forced to turn to my shotgun – a
        weapon I had largely disregarded up until this point. With the few
        resources I had left, I built stairs over my opponent’s wall, jumped
        off, flipped around, and shotgunned him. Looking back, it was as routine
        a play as it gets, but it was an absolute revelation for me at the time.
        Suddenly, everything made sense, and I realized that Fortnite Battle
        Royale is more about building than it is about shooting.
        <br /><br />
        While the little things you can use it for may seem obvious – like
        building stairs to get to the roof of a building, or making a wall to
        block an enemy’s shots – the system also gives you room to think outside
        the box. You could build around a downed teammate that you can’t help
        yet, or create a decoy fort to lure enemies into an ambush while you
        wait behind a tree. The system even provides some elegant solutions to
        getting caught outside the trademark random circles of the battle royale
        genre: If you find yourself on the wrong side of a lake or chasm, no
        problem – just make your own bridge to the other side.
        <br /><br />
        One player lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways in hopes of
        forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.
        <br /><br />
        Thanks to the building system’s simple but robust design, you can throw
        structures together in a way that suits your style. While some people
        love high towers that stretch into the sky, I like to keep things at a
        lower altitude, giving me more room to bounce between my platforms and
        the ground. One player I faced lured me into his elaborate fortress of
        hallways, with doors that led to nothing, all in hopes of forcing me
        toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.
        <br /><br />
        Creative uses of building become even more apparent in the heat of
        battle. With every building decision made in a split second, every
        player develops their own unique techniques. Where one person might
        build a wall, another builds stairs they can use to rush forward. When I
        might create a window in the middle of my wall to take an extra shot,
        someone else might try to flank around the side of the building by
        adding a new section entirely. What might start as a simple staircase at
        the beginning of a small fight between me and another person could morph
        into a twisted modern art spire as more people join in and add their own
        pieces. Fortnite’s building mechanic is an incredible system that allows
        for personal expression in a way that really isn’t present in many other
        competitive games.
        <br /><br />
        While building is a freeform system, there’s an invisible grid that
        exists around the entire island that helps every piece that you build
        snap into place, and it works almost flawlessly. Of the hundreds of
        structures I’ve placed, it was rare that even one piece landed where I
        wasn’t expecting, and I’ve never gotten myself stuck or killed as a
        result. That’s a pleasant surprise, considering how much building
        happens during chaotic firefights.
        <br /><br />
        All of this adds up to a system that is simply a joy to use. Everytime a
        fight broke out I’d get a spark of excitement as I started to think
        about how I would fight and build my way out of the situation at the
        same time. Quickly doing the math to determine if I had enough resources
        to build a staircase for a daring rush toward my enemy adds an extra
        mental thrill to combat. Every new plan felt like I was learning more
        about Fortnite Battle Royale and the way it would let me play – even if
        most of them ended with a shotgun in the face, it’s how that shotgun got
        to that face that mattered.
        <br /><br />
        Even if you find something that works, you can’t get complacent because
        part of the beauty of Fortnite Battle Royale is its constant state of
        upheaval. Epic has shown a willingness to make big changes to the weapon
        hierarchy overnight. Maybe in the next patch, snipers will replace
        shotguns as the go-to weapon class and the simple staircases and bridges
        of today will give way to the grandiose sniping fortresses of tomorrow
        as building tactics change to match the new weapon balance. That’s how
        Fortnite Battle Royale has overcome one of the biggest challenges for
        any battle royale game: Keeping up with the demand from its community
        for new and exciting gameplay and cosmetic additions.
        <br /><br />
        The pace of new content has also been impressive. Since Fortnite Battle
        Royale’s earliest release in July of 2017 Epic has made countless
        additions, from new towns and cities on the map to brand-new game modes,
        like the massive 50-vs-50 team mode from earlier this year or a recent
        patch’s Blitz mode, which has already become a fan favorite thanks to
        its speeder resource gathering and higher frequency of loot spawns.
        <br /><br />
        Even Fortnite Battle Royale’s free-to-play structure feels a step ahead
        of the competition. Every item offered in the in-game store is strictly
        cosmetic, like character skins and new pickax designs. There’s a daily
        shop, where the selection of wares refreshes every 24 hours, and a
        legendary shop that updates every week or so with items that are likely
        to never return, like the particularly gaudy pink bear costume for
        Valentine’s Day or the extremely detailed Wukong skin that was released
        as a part of Fortnite’s Chinese New Year celebration. But the biggest
        microtransaction available in Fortnite Battle Royale is the Battle Pass,
        a one-time, $10 purchase that gives you access to 100 tiers of rewards
        that unlock as you play and complete unique challenges. It’s a neat
        structure that keeps you constantly working toward the next big
        milestone.
        <br /><br />
        The influx of huge and constant gameplay changes may seem haphazard or
        dangerous when so many people already love it, running the risk of
        fixing what ain’t broke. But so far, Epic’s been smart enough about it
        to make people work to adjust their tactics while also avoiding the loss
        of the things that make Fortnite Battle Royale fun.
        <br /><br />
        The only downside to all of these interlocking mechanics is the initial
        learning curve. Though each mechanic is simple on its own, making sense
        of them all together is a bit of a challenge – especially when there
        isn’t much of a tutorial to speak of. In fact, outside of a few pieces
        of text, Fortnite Battle Royale mostly leaves you with simple
        trial-and-error and watching YouTube videos until you’re able to figure
        out what makes it tick. For most of us, that means the first dozen or so
        trips out of the Battle Bus are likely to be pretty painful (and often
        very short) experiences. But, if you stick with it, all the systems
        start to click.
        <br /><br />
        That’s Fortnite Battle Royale’s ultimate reward for the process of
        learning: An immense freedom that allows for a hundred solutions to
        tackle any problem, and none of them are just right or just wrong. This
        is the rare game where each loss fills me with more determination to
        improve than disappointment, and each death comes with a quick
        realization of what went wrong and where. I’m constantly left eager to
        queue up for another match and try to correct previous mistakes — it
        doesn’t hurt that the time between dying and dropping out of the Battle
        Bus again never takes more than 60 seconds, thanks to Fortnite’s speedy
        matchmaking and enormous pool of players.
        <br /><br />
        The first couple of matches are all about the pursuit of tasting the
        first victory, or Victory Royale, as Fortnite calls it. Achieving it and
        seeing the tepid fanfare that accompanies it, however, ends up feeling
        like a bit of a letdown. But the feat of beating 99 other players is the
        true victory, and personal satisfaction is more than enough to make up
        for the bland winner screen. Suddenly, every game I dropped into felt
        winnable, and my drive to keep improving grew even more intense. Whether
        it was my first win, my fifth, or my twenty-fifth, the sense of
        excitement from a well-played game never leaves. This was twice as true
        in duo or squad games, when the lackluster victory screen becomes merely
        a backdrop to the shouts of my friends as they boast about their
        incredible shots and recount their closest calls.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Mastering Fortnite Battle Royale’s many systems is worth every second of
        investment. Whether you go it alone or queue up with a squad, even if
        you’re the first to die or you actually manage to earn the Victory
        Royale, Fortnite’s zany style and unique blend of shooting and building
        almost never offers anything less than an outstanding time. It may not
        be the first battle royale game, and it certainly won’t be the last, but
        Fortnite sets itself apart from the crowd by giving you the freedom and
        tools to express your own personal playstyle.
