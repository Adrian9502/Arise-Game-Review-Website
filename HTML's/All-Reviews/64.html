      <span class="author"> BY CASPER TINZS </span>
      <p>
        For me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two
        favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a
        plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then
        parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the
        hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving
        around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked
        like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a
        path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran
        over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he
        nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he
        goes on a hike.
        <br /><br />
        I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such
        moments, big and small, that make San Andreas – the city of Los Santos
        and its surrounding areas – feel like a living world where anything can
        happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly
        well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and
        darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the
        series, and there’s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn’t
        been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It’s immediately noticeable that
        the cover system is more reliable and the auto-aim less touchy. The cars
        handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the
        road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for
        spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one
        of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you
        never have to do a long, tedious drive six times when you repeatedly
        fail a mission ever again.
        <br /><br />
        Grand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent, wickedly comic, and bitingly
        relevant commentary on contemporary, post-economic crisis America.
        Everything about it drips satire: it rips into the Millennial
        generation, celebrities, the far right, the far left, the middle class,
        the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar’s sharp tongue, including
        modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of
        his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset
        whilst playing a first-person shooter called Righteous Slaughter (“Rated
        PG – pretty much the same as the last game.”) It’s not exactly subtle –
        he literally has the word “Entitled” tattooed on his neck, and the
        in-game radio and TV’s outright piss-takes don’t leave much to the
        imagination – but it is often extremely funny, and sometimes provocative
        with it. Grand Theft Auto’s San Andreas is a fantasy, but the things it
        satirises – greed, corruption, hypocrisy, the abuse of power – are all
        very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream,
        GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail
        that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what
        makes its satire so biting.
        <br /><br />
        Grand Theft Auto V’s plot happily operates at the boundaries of
        plausibility, sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of
        trains, hijack military aircraft, and engage in absurd shootouts with
        scores of policemen, but its three main characters are what keep it
        relatable even at its most extreme. The well-written and acted interplay
        between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments, and
        the way that their relationships with one another developed and my
        opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its
        power. They feel like people – albeit extraordinarily f***ed-up people.
        <br /><br />
        Michael is a retired con man in his 40s, filling out around the middle
        as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout
        son, air-headed daughter, serially unfaithful wife, and very expensive
        therapist – all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown
        Los Santos who laments the gang-banger stereotype even as he’s
        reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there’s
        Trevor, a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs
        and murdering rednecks; a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is
        fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed-up
        childhood.

      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        The missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching
        plotline that involves all three, and it’s a credit to GTA V’s
        versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of
        standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about
        each of them at different times – they’re not entirely the archetypes
        that they seem to be.
        <br /><br />
        This three-character structure makes for excellent pacing and great
        variety in the storyline, but it also allows Rockstar to
        compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto’s personality. In
        doing so, it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when
        Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti-violent philosophising and
        sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here, many of Michael’s missions
        revolve around his family and his past, Franklin is usually on call for
        vehicular mayhem, and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor.
        Each has a special ability suited to his skills – Franklin can to slow
        time while driving, for example – which gives them a unique touch.
        Narratively, it’s effective – even off-mission I found myself playing in
        character, acting like a mid-life-crisis guy with anger issues as
        Michael, a thrill-seeker as Franklin, and a maniac as Trevor. The first
        thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an
        awesome car, because I felt like that’s what he’d want.
        <br /><br />
        Trevor feels a like a bit of a get-out-of-jail-free card for Rockstar,
        providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous
        behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V’s narrative
        ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome
        at first. As get-out clauses go, though, it’s pretty effective, and
        Trevor’s over-the-top missions are some of GTA V’s action-packed
        highlights. It’s a successful way of solving a problem that’s prevalent
        in open-world games: the tension between the story that the writers are
        trying to tell, and the story you create yourself within its systems and
        its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both, masterfully, allowing
        neither to undermine the other.
        <br /><br />
        The actual act of switching between them also provides a window into
        their individual lives and habits, fleshing out their personalities in a
        way that feels natural and novel. Pick a character and the camera zooms
        out over the San Andreas map, closing back in on wherever they happen to
        be. Michael might be at home watching TV when you drop in on him, or
        speeding along the motorway blasting ‘80s hits, or having a cigarette at
        the golf club; Franklin might be walking out of a strip club, munching a
        bag of snacks at home, or arguing with his ex-girlfriend; there’s a good
        chance that Trevor could be passed out half naked on a beach surrounded
        by dead bodies or, on one memorable occasion, drunk in a stolen police
        helicopter.
        <br /><br />
        It could be nearly anything, because there is a bewildering multiplicity
        of things to do in the new San Andreas – tennis, yoga, hiking, racing on
        sea and on land, flying planes, golfing, cycling, diving, hunting, and
        more. The missions are an able guide to both San Andreas’ locations and
        its activities, touring you around the map and whetting your appetite
        for independent exploration of it all. The way that we’re introduced to
        San Andreas never feels artificial – the map is completely open from the
        start, for example – which contributes to the impression that it’s a
        real place, somewhere you can get to know. If GTA IV’s Liberty City
        feels like a living city, San Andreas feels like a living world. I saw
        people walking their dogs along the beach in the country as I jet-skied
        past, arguing on the street outside a cinema in Los Santos, and camped –
        with tents and everything – overnight on Mount Chiliad, before packing
        up and continuing a hike in the morning. It’s astounding.
        <br /><br />
        The ambience changes dramatically depending on where you are, too.
        Trevor’s dusty trailer out in the middle of nowhere in Blaine County
        feels like a different world from downtown Los Santos or Vespucci Beach.
        It wasn’t until the first time I flew a plane out of the city and over
        the mountains I was cycling around a few hours before that the full
        scale of it became obvious. It pushes the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
        further than it has any right to, and it looks incredible. The biggest
        jump in quality since Grand Theft Auto IV is the character animation,
        but the world is also much more expansive, detailed, and populous. The
        price we pay for that is occasional framerate dips and texture pop-in,
        which I found became more prominent the longer I played, but never
        significantly detracted from my experience. For such a gigantic and
        flexible world it’s also remarkably bug-free – I encountered just three
        minor issues in the 35 hours I spent on my first playthrough, none of
        which caused me to fail a mission.
        <br /><br />
        San Andreas’s extraordinary sense of place is heightened by the fact
        that so much of it isn’t on the map. There’s so much going on that it’s
        easy to find things organically, rather than spend your life following a
        mission marker. I once stole a passenger jet from the airport for the
        hell of it, then parachuted onto the top of the tallest building in Los
        Santos. (I then accidentally jumped off the top and fell to my death,
        forgetting that I’d already used the parachute, but I usually leave that
        bit out.) Out driving in the country, I came across a man tied to a
        telephone pole in womens’ underwear. I chased down criminals who
        randomly swipe purses on the street, and happened across gunbattles
        between police and other miscreants, events that add a sense that this
        world isn’t completely uneventful if I wasn’t here to disrupt normalcy.
        I bought an expensive mountain bike and cycled around in the hills,
        enjoying the view. These little moments can be captured on your phone
        camera – which, brilliantly, can also take selfies. I have several snaps
        of Trevor doing his unhinged version of a smile in his underpants on top
        of a mountain.
        <br /><br />
        The story that GTA V tells through its missions takes full advantage of
        all this variety beyond driving and shooting (though the driving and
        shooting is still supremely enjoyable). It’s got so many great moments.
        It had me racing Michael’s lazy blob of a son across Vespucci Beach in
        one of many misguided attempts at father-son bonding, using a thermal
        scope to search for someone from a helicopter before chasing them across
        the city on the ground, torching a meth lab, towing cars for Franklin’s
        crack-addict cousin to prevent him from losing his job, infiltrating a
        facility from the sea in a wetsuit and flippers, piloting a submarine,
        impersonating a construction worker, doing yoga, escaping on jet skis,
        failing multiple times to land a plane loaded with drugs at a hangar out
        in the desert… it goes on and on. The days of a repetitive series of
        “drive here, find this guy, shoot this guy” are behind us. Even missions
        that would otherwise be formulaic are imbued with novelty and excitement
        by the potential to play them from three different viewpoints – in a
        shootout, Trevor might be firing RPGs from a rooftop as Michael and
        Franklin flank the enemy on the ground.
        <br /><br />
        It’s the heists – multi-stage, huge-scale events that serve as the
        story’s climactic peaks – that show Grand Theft Auto V at its most
        ambitious and accomplished. Usually there’s a choice between a more
        involved, stealthier option that will (hopefully) attract less heat, and
        an all-out option that will be less tense but more explosively chaotic –
        and what crew to take along with you on the job. All of GTA V’s missions
        are replayable at any time, letting you relive favourite moments or try
        out another approach. They also have optional objectives in the vein of
        Assassin’s Creed’s synchronisation challenges, but crucially, these are
        invisible the first time you play a mission, and so they don’t distract
        you from doing things your own way.
        <br /><br />
        Sometimes your own way won’t be the way that the designers expected you
        to do something, and though Grand Theft Auto V is usually very good at
        bending around you when that happens, there were one or two occasions
        where it wasn’t prepared for my personal brand of chaos. Overtake a car
        you’re not supposed to overtake and it will zip through lines of traffic
        as if by magic. Despite the introduction of new stealth mechanics,
        enemies will miraculously see you when the mission dictates that they
        should. Kill someone before you’re supposed to, and that’s sometimes
        Mission Failed. Most of the time the scripting is good enough to be
        invisible, but when it’s not, you really notice it – if only because
        most of the time it’s so seamless.
        <br /><br />
        As ever, some of the wittiest writing shows up on the in-game radio that
        plays behind all of the exploration and mayhem. “There’s nothing more
        successful, more masculine, more American than a big wad of cash,”
        blasts one of the in-game ads. “We know times are tough, but they don’t
        have to be tough for you. Still got some liquidity in your house? Are
        you insane?” The music selection is also typically excellent, leading to
        many of those serendipitous moments where you’re driving along and the
        perfect song comes on. During a heist, when the radio isn’t blaring the
        background, a dynamic soundtrack seriously builds tension.
        <br />
        <br />
        The satire is helped by integration of modern life into the game world.
        Every character revolves around their smartphone – it’s used to trade
        stocks, call up friends to meet up and send emails. There’s a great
        Facebook spoof, Life Invader, on the in-game Interne, with the slogan
        “Where Your Personal Information Becomes A Marketing Profile (That We
        Can Sell)”. You’ll hear adverts for preposterous parodic TV shows that
        you can actually watch on your TV at home, optionally whilst enjoying a
        toke. It might not be realistic, but it definitely feels authentic.
        <br /><br />
        It’s worth mentioning that when it comes to sex, drugs, and violence,
        GTA V pushes boundaries much further than ever before. If the morality
        police were worried about Hot Coffee, there’s a lot here that will
        provoke moral hysteria. It’s deliciously subversive, and firmly tongue
        in cheek... but once or twice, it pushes the boundaries of taste, too.
        There’s one particular scene, a torture scene in which you have no
        choice but to actively participate, that I found so troubling that I had
        difficulty playing it; even couched in obvious criticism of the US
        government’s recourse to torture post 9/11, it’s a shocking moment that
        will attract justified controversy. It brings to mind Call of Duty:
        Modern Warfare 2’s No Russian mission, except worse, and without the
        option to skip over it. Some other stuff, like the ever-present
        prostitution and extensive strip-club minigames, feels like it’s there
        just because it can be rather than because it has anything to say.
        <br /><br />
        There is nothing in San Andreas, though, that doesn’t serve Rockstar’s
        purpose in creating an exaggerated projection of America that’s suffused
        with crime, violence and sleaze. There are no good guys in GTA V.
        Everyone you meet is a sociopath, narcissist, criminal, lunatic, sadist,
        cheat, liar, layabout, or some combination of those. Even a man who pays
        good money to assassinate Los Santos’ worst examples of corporate greed
        is playing the stock market to his advantage whilst he does it. In a
        world like this, it’s not hard to see why violence is so often the first
        recourse. All the pieces fit.
      </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>
        Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game,
        but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary
        America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to
        the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every
        conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right.
        No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and
        there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for
        mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story
        without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed
        adventures through San Andreas. It is one of the very best video games
        ever made.
