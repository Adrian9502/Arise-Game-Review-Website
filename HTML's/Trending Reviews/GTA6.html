      <p>
        GTA 6 is officially coming in 2025, and it's set to take us back to Vice
        City in the state of Leonida. The news came by way of the release of the
        official GTA 6 trailer 1 – which was posted a day earlier than scheduled
        as the result of the risk of a leak. posted a day ahead of schedule
        thanks to the risk of a leak.
        <br /><br />
        We've been poring over the trailer since it released to take in all of
        the noteworthy features on display. In our GTA 6 trailer breakdown, you
        can find a overview of 12 interesting details you might have missed in
        what looks set to be one big open-world setting that takes Vice City to
        new heights. With a closer look at the new protagonists, settings,
        vehicles, and more, there's certainly a lot to unpack already.
      </p>
      <h2>GTA 6 trailer 1</h2>
      <p>
        The GTA 6 reveal trailer is here and it is everything that we hoped it
        would be. While Rockstar had originally set the GTA 6 trailer release
        date for Tuesday, December 5, a leak pushed the publisher to get the
        long-awaited first look at the new Grand Theft Auto out into the world a
        little earlier. The GTA 6 trailer, which you can view above, gives us a
        first look at the return to Vice City and the new twin-protagonists.
        <br /><br />
        Rockstar has confirmed that the GTA 6 release date is set for 2025. The
        news arrived as part of the reveal trailer, noting that Grand Theft Auto
        6 is set to release TBC 2025 – no further clarification has been posted
        on when.
        <br /><br />
        Prior to the reveal trailer, internet sleuths had been making some
        educated guesses. Multiple sources have corroborated a rumor that GTA 6
        will release in 2025, which was part of a larger info drop that
        suggested that Grand Theft Auto 6 would be set in a modern-day Vice
        City.
        <br /><br />
        Interestingly, Take-Two, the Rockstar owner, continues to imply GTA 6 is
        out by March 2025 while saying nothing about it. CEO Strauss Zelnick
        says "we remain confident that we are positioning our business for a
        significant inflection point in fiscal 2025, which we believe will
        include new record levels of operating performance." That significant
        boost to revenue predictions is supposedly due to the GTA 6 launch.
        <br /><br />
        So far, it has been confirmed that GTA 6 will be coming to PS5 and Xbox
        Series X/S when it arrives. The news came by way of an official press
        release from Take Two, which states that: "GTA 6 is coming to
        PlayStation 5 computer entertainment systems and Xbox Series X|S games
        and entertainment systems in 2025". There's currently no mention of a PC
        launch, which might suggest it will follow a similar route to some of
        the previous GTA games that released on consoles first, before arriving
        on PC at a later date.
      </p>

      <h2>Will GTA 6 be on PS4 and Xbox One?</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        As revealed in the official press release, GTA 6 is currently only
        slated to arrive on the PS5 and Xbox Series X and won't be coming to PS4
        or Xbox One when it launches in 2025 - making it a current-gen
        exclusive.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is GTA 6 taking so long?</h2>
      <hr style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" />
      <p>
        A lot of you are wondering why GTA 6 is taking so long to come out. The
        truth is that, between the success of GTA 5 and GTA Online, not to
        mention the scope of Red Dead Redemption 2, it's no surprise that
        Rockstar is taking its time. The studio said as much when it confirmed
        that GTA 6 was in development. Rockstar went out of its way to cite the
        "the unprecedented longevity of GTA 5" – which has been updated and
        re-released multiple times in the last nine years.
